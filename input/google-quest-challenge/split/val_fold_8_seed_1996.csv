3421,3421,5445,Should you let users know if an email has been taken during registration validation?,"In many web applications, email is required to be a unique field, and users aren't allowed to register an account if their email already exists in the database.

When performing validation on the registration form, you would presumably check if an email has been taken, and let the user know if it has since they can either pick a different one or try to reset their password.

However, if you are providing this feedback, it seems like malicious users could test to see if users exist in the database.  Someone could plausibly test your site against leaked data from big-name hacks, and if the users are reusing their passwords across sites, then your site is potentially vulnerable.

The solution to this could be simply giving more generic feedback about what went wrong without specifically mentioning email, although that could be frustrating for the average user trying to sign up.  And if your sign up form simply requires an email and password, it is still pretty obvious that if any error is encountered it is likely that the email already exists in the database.

",IsThatQueeblo,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/68108,"An intuitive and simple solution is to make sure that an automated script (malicious script) cannot try to register with a list of e-mails in order to figure out which ones are registered.

In this way, even if few user e-mails are tried, a massive number cannot be checked. Note we are assuming strong CAPTCHA cannot be easily broken. 

But if it is super sensitive and you must hide who is registered at the target website even from human users, then finish the registration and do not show any error message to the user that the e-mail is already registered; and just inform the user at the end of the process that now they have to confirm the e-mail belongs to them, please go and check your e-mail; In the backend, if the e-mail is already registered, then do nothing; just send an e-mail to the owner of the e-mail and inform them: seems you tried to re-register at our service again, if you have forgotten you have an account with us, this is your username, and if you cannot remember your password, go to the password reset page.

5042,5042,8024,Can anyone learn to sing?,"It may seem as a kinda dumb question, and I'm totally aware of this. But, what I'm going to ask may be specific enough to not get closed:

I've been playing guitar and also a few other instruments for quite a while now, but I just can't sing. I can hear a melody in my head, but even if I try to hit the first note, I will fail very often. Now what I want to ask is, can anyone learn to sing in a manner that ""won't hurt the ear of a non-musician""? I'm not asking if anyone could be the next Freddie Mercury, but does anyone have the ability to sing some backing vocals if needed, without just sounding terrible?

I always find it hard to get question on music get to the point, so i'll try it with this: Can anyone achieve semi-professional level of singing, even if one doesn't have a ""good"" voice?
",Michael Kunst,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/7091,"ABSOLUTELY! I'm very enthusiastic about this question, which I hope is conveyed by my use of exclamation marks. The reason being is because I can personally relate to this question.

I have always wanted to learn to sing since I learned to play guitar. I was very reluctant at first and very terrible. I was put down a lot by people telling me to stop singing or stop trying (including my loving mother), but alas I pressed on because I enjoyed it even if I was terrible.

I want to give you a few tips to learn to sing because I wish I had these tips when I was learning. I learned all on my own, and that's why I know anybody can.


First things first, the best piece of advice I can give you is to buy a good computer mic like the Yeti Silver (that's what I use) and it's currently at a big discount right now from Amazon. Then get a good pair of over-ear headphones. Connect your mic to your computer, and connect your head phones to your mic. Put em on and start singing. This is good because now you can hear yourself instantly how other people hear you and it lets you adjust your voice right away instead of recording and waiting to play the record back until you can hear yourself. Trust me there is a huge difference--while we can hear our own voices well enough to get the basics, it is a world of difference to hear yourself with a microphone.
Learn to accept that your voice has certain qualities that make it different from other voices. When I started I always tried singing with a sort of whispery head voice because I didn't like how my natural voice sounded and thought it to be aweful. The truth is, all of your voices (every part of your vocal system) can sound great with training. This includes falsetto which will sound bad until you practice and smooth it out. Actually I recently posed a question asking if I could make my falsetto like Brian Mcknight and I found out for myself not too long after because I was practicing it a lot. Check it out here.
Practice singing scales. It's good that you can play guitar because it gives you the advantage of having a musical ear over someone who doesn't play anything. Also it gives you something to guide your voice with. You know when you're tuning your strings to each other without a tuner--ie hit the sixth string on the fifth fret and make it so it sounds like the fifth string. Well you can hear when it's out of tune or not, so all you have to do is practice singing say a C scale. Sing it and when your voice is off fix it until it matches then go up and down. Practice the vocal dexterity of switching notes. I'll tab the C scale for you for convenience. At the bottom is the C scale tabbed for guitar.
Use Youtube to find vocal practice lessons. This is good to give you new ways of practicing your vocals. There's a lot more to singing that just being in tune, and you'll find that out as you sing more. Of course this can get kind of boring, but it's good to explore.
Pay attention to good singers. When you hear a good singer, pay attention to their vocals and what they are doing and how it sounds. The more I learned to sing, the more I could distinguish between different kinds of voices. (When I say voices, I'm referring to head, chest, and falsetto etc.) It's like when you can already play guitar and you hear a guitar song, you can pick out a lot more parts because you already speak the guitar langauge--bow chika wow wow. Did you just hear the wawaw pedal there? :)
ENJOY IT! Screw what anybody tells you about singing. You are your own person and if you want to be good at something or learn something you need to practice. When you start learning you're not gonna be good, but you need to have the conviction to keep it up and put other people's thoughts and comments out of your mind. One day you're gonna be good and they will eat their words. I was put down a lot when I was learning, but I kept learning because I wanted so bad to be good and I enjoyed it. Also, it helps to have a quiet place where you can practice to slowly gain confidence before you're practicing around other people. 


Hope this helps. Good luck and keep practicing.

3192,3192,5086,How to render a curve without creating meshes?,"I am able to render a curve by bevelling it.

However, for a scientific visualisation that I am working on, this doesn't render the way I wish it to. I would like the curve to render as a fixed width line irrespective of the distance from the camera.

Currently, I have to adjust the bevelling amount based on camera distance, and also play with rendering samples to get a smooth looking line.

Is there a cleaner approach that I am missing?

I am currently using the ""cycles"" renderer, but I am open to suggestions for any other renderer. Thanks!

",HRJ,https://blender.stackexchange.com/users/81,"As the distance from camera to an object increases the apparent size of the object will decrease, in perspective things farther away always appear smaller.

As for increasing samples to get a clean result - that is the nature of cycles. It depends largely on the material and world settings. If you are using simple colours then the blender internal will be just as easy to setup without having to adjust sample amounts.

You can also adjust the resolution of both the bevel and curve to get smoother surface results instead of converting to mesh if the surface of the curve is not smooth enough.

5400,5400,8577,Reflection across the plane,"Let $T: \Bbb R^3 \rightarrow \Bbb R^3$ be the linear transformation given by reflecting across the plane $S=\{x:-x_1+x_2+x_3=0\}$ (...) 

Then, $S=\gen[(1,1,0),(1,0,1)]\$

But how can I get the matrix $R_v$ such that reflects across $S$? 

Thanks!
",Tomi Sebastián Juárez,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/67807,"The vector $\vec{n}=\langle -1,1,1 \rangle$ is normal to the plane, thus $T$ maps $\vec{n}$ to $-\vec{n}=\langle 1,-1,-1 \rangle$. It also fixes the vectors $\vec{u}= \langle 1,1, 0 \rangle$ and $\vec{v} = \langle -1,1,-2 \rangle$ that are perpendicular to each other and to $\vec{n}$.  More generaly, $\vec{u}$ could be any vector whose dot product with $\vec{n}$ is zero (such vectors are easy to find) and $\vec{v} = \vec{n}\times\vec{u}$.

In the basis determined by $\vec{n}$, $\vec{u}$, and $\vec{v}$, your matrix looks like
$$\left(

  -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
  0 &amp; 1  &amp; 0 \\
  0 &amp; 0 &amp;  1 \\

\right).$$

The matrix $A$ whose columns are formed by $\vec{n}$, $\vec{u}$, and $\vec{v}$ form a similarity transformation that changes the diagonal matrix $E$ formed by the eigenvalues $-1$, $1$, and $1$ into the matrix you want.  Thus, your matrix is

$$A \cdot E \cdot A^{-1} =

Addendum

This technique can be used to derive Bubba's answer, although I used Mathematica to do the heavy lifting for me.

A = Transpose[{{a, b, c}, {0, -c, b}, {b^2 + c^2, -a*b, -a*c}}];
FullSimplify[A.{{-1, 0, 0}, {0, 1, 0}, {0, 0, 1}}.Inverse[A]] /.
  a^2 + b^2 + c^2 -&gt; 1 // MatrixForm


$$

 -2 a b &amp; 1-2 b^2 &amp; -2 b c \\
 -2 a c &amp; -2 b c &amp; 2 \left(a^2+b^2\right)-1 \\
\end{array}
\right)
$$

However, seeing Bubba's answer reminded me wonderful and simple Householder reflections are. Just define the function $f:{\mathbb R}^n \rightarrow {\mathbb R}^n$ by $f(x)=\vec{x}-2\vec{n}(\vec{n}^T\vec{x})$, where $\vec{x}$ is a column vector and $\vec{n}$ is a unit column vector denoting your normal.  It's super simple to check that $f$ maps $\vec{n}$ to $-\vec{n}$:
$$f(\vec{n}) = \vec{n}-2\vec{n}(\vec{n}^T\vec{n}) = \vec{n}-2\vec{n}1=-\vec{n},$$
where $\vec{n}^T\vec{n}=1$, since $\vec{n}$ is a unit vector.  It's also super simple to see that any vector $\vec{x}$ perpendicular to $\vec{n}$ is fixed by $f$, since
$$f(\vec{x}) = \vec{x}-2\vec{n}(\vec{n}^T\vec{x}) = \vec{x}-2\vec{n}0=\vec{x}.$$

Factoring out the $\vec{x}$ from the definition of $f$, we see the matrix you need:
$$I-2\vec{n}\,\vec{n}^T.$$

Applying this to your situation, we get the same matrix as above.
\begin{align}

5725,5725,9068,Why would a sump pump cycle when pumping large amounts of water?,"In my septic system, I have a sump pump that pumps the liquid into the drainage field. We have a tank alarm in this tank with the pump, but someone (not sure if it was me or someone else) forgot to turn back on the alarm one time. So now that 1000 gallon tank is over flowing. The pump circuit has been blowing for me at the fuse box. It seems to blow the circuit based on getting a bunch of rain. I'll do a separate question for that.

My question is this. I can hear the pump run for a bit (I haven't kept track of the time) then stop. After a while it will start again. Is there a safety or something that would cause the pump to not run until there is no water left? This happens no matter if the float is hooked up or I am just plugged in straight. Or could it be the drainage field is full of water and needs to seep out so there is room for more?

I know the tank isn't empty cause shortly after the pump stops, water starts seeping out of the lid again. (and the alarm light is still on).

5906,5906,9358,"Do 802.11b devices slow down other, newer networks on or near the same channel?","I believe it is well-known and accepted that 802.11b devices connected to networks using newer protocols will slow down the newer devices on that network. The workaround, of course, is to disable 802.11b support so nobody with an 802.11b device will connect.

However, what's less clear is whether 802.11b devices on neighboring networks can cause similar performance issues.

Scenario:


An 802.11n network is on 2.4 GHz channel 6.
An 802.11b device is connected to a neighboring network that's operating on a channel between 2-10.


Questions:


Will the 802.11b device cause the 802.11n network to slow down, any more than it might if it were an 802.11g/n device?
If ""yes"" to #1, does it matter if the 802.11b device is on the same channel (6), or just on a close neighbor (2-5 or 7-10)?
If ""yes"" to #1, does configuring the 802.11n network for n-only operation solve this issue, or does it only work when the legacy devices are trying to connect to the 802.11n network?

",Iszi,https://superuser.com/users/50086,"First, let me say for the sake of others reading this that the presence of older-standard 802.11 gear never causes a newer-standard 802.11 network to fall all the way back to the older-standard rates. That's an old myth that has never been true.

There are two main ways that the presence of older-standard 802.11 gear slows down newer-standard networks:


Because the older gear can only use slower signaling rates, it takes a lot longer (a lot more airtime) for the older gear to send or receive a given packet than it would take modern gear. Imagine being in a panel discussion with one guy who TalksReallyFast and another guy who S - p - e - a - k - s - R - e - a - l - l - y - S - l - o - w - l - y. Every time it's the slow-talker's turn to answer a question, he wastes a lot of the panel's allotted time with his slow talking. The fast talkers don't get as much time as they would have had without slow talker present, so the overall amount of words said during the panel discussion is a lot fewer.
Because older gear doesn't know the more modern modulation schemes, it can't detect the transmissions of the more modern equipment very well. So the modern gear has to enter ""protection"" mode that helps the slower gear know when the modern gear is going to be transmitting. Those legacy-protection modes slow things down some, but not drastically. 


Some people make the rookie mistake of thinking they can solve #1 by refusing to let older gear on their networks, and they think that means they can solve #2 but disabling the legacy protection modes. But what they don't realize is that legacy devices on another network on the same channel or an overlapping channel will still cause both the #1 and #2 problems, and the the only thing worse than having to use legacy-protection mode is when you need it but don't use it. That allows the legacy devices to step on the modern devices transmissions all the time, which can crater performance.

So, to answer your questions:


Yes, the presence of an 802.11b device on an overlapping channel can cause the other network to slow down some. It's hard to predict exactly how much.
In general, having if your neighboring 802.11 network can't be on a completely non-overlapping channel, it's best to have it on the exact same channel as you, not a partially-overlapping one. When 802.11 devices are on the exact same channel, they do the best job of yielding to each other nicely. When they're on partially-overlapping channels, they have a harder time seeing each others transmissions reliably, and are more likely to stomp on each others transmissions (by that I mean transmit at the same time; collide).
Nope, configuring for N-only doesn't solve anything in this scenario.

",Иван Бишевац,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/34008,"In theory, there are at least five possible approaches.

Top-Down:

Start with UI mock-shots or a paper prototype. Turn them into real dialogs, and work your way from the button handlers and other controls down through the logic and to the database.

Bottom-Up:

Start with the data structures (probably the database schema). Then add logic (modelling real-world processes); finally, your UI is just an interface to trigger the logic and display the results.

Logic first:

Start with the program logic, implementing data access and a rudimentary UI as needed. Then formalize and harden the data structures, and finally flesh out the UI properly.

Meet in the middle:

Start with database schema and UI, and simultaneously work towards the point where they meet. With this approach, the logic comes last.

Horizontal expansion:

Start by identifying the absolute minimum amount of functionality that would do something interesting, and implement the whole stack (data structures, logic, and UI) for this part. It could be just a basic CRUD cycle with a simple edit dialog for just one entity. Then start adding more features, implementing the whole stack for each feature (hence 'horizontal').

Each of these has pros and cons. 

Top-down gives you something visible early in the process, and allows you to check your functional design with stakeholders - mock-shots often tell users more about a design than flowcharts or walls of text.

Bottom-up gives you a chance to design a rock-solid database schema before you commit to anything; since a database schema is notoriously hard to modify once released, you want to get this part right - the impact of modifying a UI is much smaller and produces fewer and less severe bugs.

Logic-first means you can test the logic before spending serious time on the database and the presentation, which is especially interesting if your logic is going to be really complex.

Meet-in-the-middle combines the advantages of bottom-up and top-down, but you'll have to jump back and forth between two tasks, and you risk ending up with logic that is more complex than necessary because your two ends don't meet naturally.

Horizontal expansion goes well with an iterative workflow, and it has the added advantage that, if you prioritize well, you will have a working application at any given time, so if you don't make a deadline, you will have a version that has fewer features, but is still fully functional, as opposed to a version that has a complete database, but no UI at all.

1828,1828,2899,Building hand strength for when tapping on the guitar,"I've been practicing on my tapping ability. An example of what I mean by tapping can be viewed here, notice how the right hand hits the strings. 

I'm currently using all four fingers excluding the thumb to tap the guitar. I find my pinky is not as strong as my other fingers when it comes to applying the appropriate strength on the string. What are some exercises I can do to increase my overall finger strength when tapping? More tapping?

As a sidenote, I've noticed that I use the momentum of my forearm to help apply the appropriate pressure on the string I'm trying to hit. If I remove that momentum and only use force created by the movement of my finger the pressure is significantly less. I was hoping these exercises would also help me to not rely on my forearm as much.

An example of what I mean by tapping can be viewed here, notice how the right hand hits the strings. 

I'm currently using all four fingers excluding the thumb to tap the guitar. I find my pinky is not as strong as my other fingers when it comes to applying the appropriate strength on the string. What are some exercises I can do to increase my overall finger strength when tapping? More tapping?

As a sidenote, I've noticed that I use the momentum of my forearm to help apply the appropriate pressure on the string I'm trying to hit. If I remove that momentum and only use force created by the movement of my finger the pressure is significantly less. I was hoping these exercises would also help me to not rely on my forearm as much.
","In moments where you have nothing to do (sitting on the bus, watching tv), you could train your hands by tapping on you knee for example. You could also stretch your fingers backwards and try to counter that with your finger muscles to basically train them.

Also, what really helped me building strength in my left pinky was starting to play the piano.

2606,2606,4148,Invariance of dynamical system under a transformation,"I have come across an interesting property of a dynamical system, being transformed by a map, but i haven't been able to figure out why this is happening (for quite some time now actually). Any help is greatly appreciated. Here goes then:

Let M be a n-D manifold and $\dot x=F(x)u_1, F\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times m}, x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}, u_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$ be a control system evolving on M (F is the system matrix i.e. state transition function, and $u_1$ is the input of the system. For all practical purposes $u_1$ is an m-vector from an input space $\mathbb{R}^{m}$). Now let $x=\Psi (y)$ be a coordinate change on M and $u_2=M(y)u_1$ a transformation of the input $u_1$ of the first system. By applying these maps on the system, you get the new equations  $\dot y=F(y)u_2$. As you may notice, F is the same in both systems. The problem is why is this happening i.e. for what systems and transformations does this property hold?

A little more elaboration

It is useful to investigate the maps more closely. In the general case one has

$\dot x=D\Psi \dot y$
$\dot x= F(x)u_1$

thus
$\dot y=D\Psi ^{-1} F(x)u_1$, (1)

where $D\Psi$ is the Jacobian matrix of $\Psi$. In our case it actually turns out that:  

$\dot y=F(y)M(y)u_1$. (2)

You can then consider that $u_2=M(y)u_1$ and get the final system,

$\dot y=F(y)u_2$,

that is, the same system.
 By (1),(2) you get,

$D\Psi ^{-1} F(x)u_1=F(y)M(y)u_1 \Rightarrow (D\Psi ^{-1} F(x)-F(y)M(y))u_1=0$. 

Since this holds for every $u_1$, you have the condition,

$F(\Psi (y))=D\Psi F(y)M(y)$

So, what does this condition imply? What systems F and maps $\Psi$ hold this property (of system invariance)? I should note that F is nonlinear and a case study where this actually happens is the kinematic model of a unicycle robot i.e. this. Any ideas?
",Jorge,https://mathoverflow.net/users/19928,"Let me reply taking M to be the identity (indeed M is somewhat cosmetic to the discussion).

The identity $F\circ Ψ=DΨ\circ F$ is what one considers for example in the Grobman-Hartman theorem, passing from a dynamics to its linearization say at a fixed point.

Any help is greatly appreciated. Here goes then:

Let M be a n-D manifold and $\dot x=F(x)u_1, F\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times m}, x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}, u_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$ be a control system evolving on M (F is the system matrix i.e. state transition function, and $u_1$ is the input of the system. For all practical purposes $u_1$ is an m-vector from an input space $\mathbb{R}^{m}$). Now let $x=\Psi (y)$ be a coordinate change on M and $u_2=M(y)u_1$ a transformation of the input $u_1$ of the first system. By applying these maps on the system, you get the new equations  $\dot y=F(y)u_2$. As you may notice, F is the same in both systems. The problem is why is this happening i.e. for what systems and transformations does this property hold?

A little more elaboration

It is useful to investigate the maps more closely. In the general case one has

$\dot x=D\Psi \dot y$
$\dot x= F(x)u_1$

thus
$\dot y=D\Psi ^{-1} F(x)u_1$, (1)

where $D\Psi$ is the Jacobian matrix of $\Psi$. In our case it actually turns out that:  

$\dot y=F(y)M(y)u_1$. (2)

You can then consider that $u_2=M(y)u_1$ and get the final system,

$\dot y=F(y)u_2$,

that is, the same system.
 By (1),(2) you get,

$D\Psi ^{-1} F(x)u_1=F(y)M(y)u_1 \Rightarrow (D\Psi ^{-1} F(x)-F(y)M(y))u_1=0$. 

Since this holds for every $u_1$, you have the condition,

$F(\Psi (y))=D\Psi F(y)M(y)$

So, what does this condition imply? What systems F and maps $\Psi$ hold this property (of system invariance)? I should note that F is nonlinear and a case study where this actually happens is the kinematic model of a unicycle robot i.e. this. Any ideas?
","Let me reply taking M to be the identity (indeed M is somewhat cosmetic to the discussion).

The identity $F\circ Ψ=DΨ\circ F$ is what one considers for example in the Grobman-Hartman theorem, passing from a dynamics to its linearization say at a fixed point. The possibilities for F are endless; $F$ would then be a topological conjugacy, perhaps locally, although maybe not very regular, more precisely at most Hölder continuous in general. Moreover, $F$ need not satisfy any invariance properties, which if I understand correctly is your main concern.

3639,3639,5807,Why would a sump pump cycle when pumping large amounts of water?,"In my septic system, I have a sump pump that pumps the liquid into the drainage field. We have a tank alarm in this tank with the pump, but someone (not sure if it was me or someone else) forgot to turn back on the alarm one time. So now that 1000 gallon tank is over flowing. The pump circuit has been blowing for me at the fuse box. It seems to blow the circuit based on getting a bunch of rain. I'll do a separate question for that.

My question is this. I can hear the pump run for a bit (I haven't kept track of the time) then stop. After a while it will start again. Is there a safety or something that would cause the pump to not run until there is no water left? This happens no matter if the float is hooked up or I am just plugged in straight.

Detail. If $a$ is (for instance left) invertible of left inverse $c$ then $ca = 1$ so that $ca^2 = a$ which implies that $c^2 a^2 = ca = 1$, that is $c^2 b = 1$ and $b$ is invertible.

I notice quadratic residues of odd prime $13$ :

","If $a^2 = b$ in a ring $R$ with unit, $a$ is invertible if and only if $b$ is and then $b^{-1} = (a^{-1})^2$. (Tell if this is clear to you, if not, I'll detail in an edit.) Apply this to $R = \mathbf{Z} / n \mathbf{Z}$. Apply the latter to the case $n = p$ is prime. ;-)

Detail. If $a$ is (for instance left) invertible of left inverse $c$ then $ca = 1$ so that $ca^2 = a$ which implies that $c^2 a^2 = ca = 1$, that is $c^2 b = 1$ and $b$ is invertible.

1902,1902,3030,Measuring Resistance of a Wire With an ADC,"I'm trying to design a circuit which can measure small resistances down to 0.1 Ohm and a max. of 10 Ohms. I won't be measuring actual resistors but rather large coil of wires, upto 500 m (as you can imagine, these wires are quite thick).

Here's the circuit I came up with:


The circuit works by maintaining a constant current through the device under test, R2. With a current of 100 mA, R2 would develop a voltage between 10 mV to 50 mV.

I think in an ideal world this would work but in practice I may have a hard time measuring 0.1 Ohms with this - mainly due to the ADC. Let's assume the ADC is 10-bit with VREF of 5V. This translates to 5mV per step. If R2 = 0.1 and Iout = 100 mA, then the voltage present at the ADC would be 50 mV - but I'm not sure how buried under noise this would be.

My question is, should I increase the gain to, say, 50. If the gain is 50, then the voltage present at the ADC would be 500 mV - but the max. measurable resistance would be 1 Ohms. To measure 10 Ohms, I would need to lower the current to 10 mA instead of 100 mA. A way to do that would be use an FET to switch out R1 and connect a 20 Ohm resistor at Iout.

I don't need the circuit to measure the resistance precisely - a tolerance of +/- 10% is fine.
",Saad,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/3966,"Please, don't use an LM324 if you want to do precision measurements.  

Your opamp has a gain of 5, but you're not using that: Your output is the inverting input, where you have the same signal as the non-inverting, so that's gain x 1.  

The best choice would be an instrumentation amplifier, where you connect the cable's ends to the two inputs. Use a series resistor to ground to create an offset, because InAmps can't go to the rails (at least the 3-opamp types can't). You can use that resistor as a sense resistor for the current source:  



\$V_{IN}\$ sets the current of the current source: 100 mA/V. Suppose the cable's resistance is 5 &Omega;, then the InAmp will see a 500 mV difference on its input. A gain of 10 (gain resistor isn't shown; CircuitLab doesn't have a symbol for InAmps) will give you 5 V out, or 1 V/&Omega;. By changing \$V_{IN}\$ you can change the total gain. Note that Q1 may need a heatsink, especially if Vcc is rather high.  

 

If you expect high resistances you can make a resistor divider with 1 precision resistor to Vref, and one to ground:



The voltage across the cable will be

\$ V_{CABLE} = \dfrac{R_{CABLE}}{R_{CABLE} + 2 R} V_{REF} \$

but if \$R_{CABLE}\$ &lt;&lt; \$2 R\$ the voltage may be too low for an accurate measurement. A low value for \$R\$ helps, but will draw much current.

The MCP6N11 has Rail-to-Rail output and exists in different types for different gains, among which one for a gain of minimum 100.

edit
markrages comments that we don't need an InAmp, and he's right. Here's the solution with a differential amplifier using an opamp:  



The gain is determined by R1 through R4, and if R1 = R3 and R2 = R4 will be   

\$ G = \dfrac{R2}{R1}\$

An InAmp will give you more precision though, and it won't cost you an arm and a leg, so why not?

992,992,1568,Can I rest cement posts directly on the bedrock to build a structure for a large shed?,"So I live in Canada, where winters are cold, and where there's not much soil above the bedrock. I would like to build a sturdy structure for an existing ""shed"" (in fact a 100-year old former stable or something) that's about 4m by 5m (12'x 15') and that's kind of collapsing. Currently, there's no real structure to speak of: it's only 2-inch thick boards piled up and nailed together, with small posts (like 2x4s) in the corners, resting on slabs of cement or something, each one about half as big as a basketball.

There's only about 60 cm of soil above the (granit) bedrock, and I was considering pouring concrete ""posts"" to rest directly on the bedrock, then using them as a basis for my structure (placing a metal plate on top that I can put a wood post on). My neighbour says that in the spring the meltwater will accumulate over the bedrock and may damage the concrete posts. Also, I would guess the ground probably freezes down to the bedrock in winter.

Any thoughts about this? alternative solutions? Note that I don't want to take the shed apart because it's 100-year-old wood and I think I would inflict substantial damage to it.

I would like to build a sturdy structure for an existing ""shed"" (in fact a 100-year old former stable or something) that's about 4m by 5m (12'x 15') and that's kind of collapsing. Currently, there's no real structure to speak of: it's only 2-inch thick boards piled up and nailed together, with small posts (like 2x4s) in the corners, resting on slabs of cement or something, each one about half as big as a basketball.

There's only about 60 cm of soil above the (granit) bedrock, and I was considering pouring concrete ""posts"" to rest directly on the bedrock, then using them as a basis for my structure (placing a metal plate on top that I can put a wood post on). My neighbour says that in the spring the meltwater will accumulate over the bedrock and may damage the concrete posts. Also, I would guess the ground probably freezes down to the bedrock in winter.

Any thoughts about this? alternative solutions? Note that I don't want to take the shed apart because it's 100-year-old wood and I think I would inflict substantial damage to it.
","Piles to bedrock (essentially what you are proposing, albeit with really short piles) is an excellent foundation. I'd suggest drilling some holes in the rock so you can pin (with steel rebar) the base of the concrete post/pile into the bedrock.

2034,2034,3241,Interpolated FIR filter,"I am confused about this Q&amp;A :  Interpolation by factor of 2

If my input signal 
$$
x[n]= x0,x1,x2,x3
$$
then according to the threads explaination my $v[n]$ will be 

$$
v[n]=x0,0,x1,0,x2,0,x3,0
$$

$x[n] \rightarrow$ zeropad $\rightarrow v[n]$

$v[n]\rightarrow$ LPF $\rightarrow y[m]$

My $y[m]$ is the output of LPF which removes aliases. So basically LPF transfer function is given as 

$$
y[m] = v[n]*h[n]
$$

i,e. $y[m]=\displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}h(m-n)v(n)$

So here $h[m]$ is my filter coefficients and  $v[n]$ is my zero padded input signal...
so, if I multiply zero with my filter coefficients, then my output will also be zero...

If I send 10 input samples, after zero padding I will get 20 samples, out of which 10 will be zero....

So what is the use of getting zero as my output? Correct me if am wrong (I know I am wrong, but please give me some idea how zero padding &amp; LPF is helping in this regard).

For FIR filter: $y(n)=h(0)x(n)+h(1)x(n−1)+....+h(N−1)x(n−N+1)$,
 where $x(n)$ is the input signal,
 $y(n)$ is the output signal, 
$h(n)$ is the impulse response, 
and $N$ is the filter length. 

For simplicity, I am taking order $N=4$,and some random numbers

    (time) n --&gt; [ 0  1  2  3] 
         x[n]--&gt; [ 2  4  6  8]

Lets calculate for $y[2.5]=h(0)x(2.5)+h(1)x(1.5)+h(2)x(0.5)+h(3)x(-0.5)$ 

so here $x(2.5)=x(1.5)=x(0.5)=0$

I have talked to several senior mathematicians including my advisor, but they all seem to have different opinions. I just want to hear some more opinions on the following:


How important is prestige? Suppose that I have an offer from school X, which is fairly prestigious (something like top 10, which isn't a well-defined notion). Also suppose that I have an offer from school Y, which is not as prestigious but a better match research-wise. Suppose that the ranking of school Y is approximately n (again, not a well-defined notion). For which values of n should I choose school X over school Y? My goal is to become a tenure-track professor in a PhD-granting institution.
What makes a good postdoc supervisor? I can think of the following criteria: compatible research interests, being well-known in one's field, compatible personalities, generous with time, etc. Am I missing anything else?

",hithere,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/10447,"nagniemerg is absolutely right that at the end of the day, your results will be much more important than a name on your CV.  I think being at a prestigious institution is very useful for getting a first look at your application (which is a f***ing valuable thing, as Rod Blagojevich would say); if the rest of what's there doesn't stand up, getting that look won't help much.  

That said, I would think carefully about how sure you are that institution Y really will provide a better research environment.  Prestige tends to correlate (far from perfectly) with having an active department with a lot of seminars and visitors, which can often be more valuable than day-to-day contact with a single advisor.  Having higher-quality students and colleagues can make you a better researcher.

I also think there's a lot to be said for the uncertainty of life.  Maybe you'll go somewhere and whoever you were going to work with will get a job somewhere else, or have a baby, or go on sabbatical.  Maybe you'll start a collaboration with someone you don't even know exists yet.  It's all very hard to predict, and on some level you have to go with your gut.  You could do a lot worse than just going with the most prestigious option, but if other factors seem to point another direction, I don't think you should just ignore them.

EDIT:  I wrote this is a bit of hurry last night, and I realize it might be a bit unhelpful. However, it's honestly quite difficult to say anything general, and you indicate that senior mathematicians who know you and know what your options are cannot come to a consensus.  To me this indicates that probably you will not be able to conclusively figure out where is the better choice.  This is not to say it doesn't matter, but once the uncertainties are sufficiently large, one might as well flip a coin (or at least flip a coin until you get the answer you want).

I did briding between PHP and C# in some of my web based projects. What I did: create an ASP.NET MVC project which exposes a RESTful API. The methods exposed by this API are then called from PHP via HTTP (using CURL). I used JSON as a data exchange format to pass data from PHP to C# and back again. This worked good as the two applications were on different servers.

I could also imagine some kind of socket server. E. g. a background process written in C# is listening on some port, and then you connect to it via PHP´s socket functions.

First, /dev/sda is NOT recognized correctly! This disk is 500GB. 

Second, mounting /dev/sda2 is not possible:

Third, trying to format the disk, it really sees only the sectors until 320GB:

I have other USB hard drives with 320GB and they really mount fine. 


Is this a limitation of RPi? Or a problem with this specific Hard Drive?   
How can I use this large disk with my RPi? 


update: solved the issue with help of the commentators here...

here is what I did ...


I thought I have some weired issue with Debian Wheezy &amp; gparted. So, I reformatted the hard drive to NTFS. Before that I ERASED the partition table. 
And created a new single NTFS partition. 
Bingo! RPi, identified the partition. However, it claimed my Drive is now 2TB big, and recommended I will use GPT:

whoops! That is WRONG!

So, I disconnected the hard drive again. re-connented it to my laptop. I erased the partition table again, and re-created the partition table using fdisk on RPi! not on my laptop! This time, I took a short cut, and created the disk partition with ext4 directly. 
    I plugged the hard-drive to RPi and BINGO!

conclusion (?)

My guess is that gparted in Debian Wheezy includes some nasty bug which is sometimes showing it's ugly face. I would report a bug if I had more solid evidence. But ... since I have only one 500GB hard drive, and I don't want to
risk the health of this hard drive reformatting it so many time, I will settle this with it. If you happen to bump into this post, and you have had similar problems with large SATA drives and partitioning on wheezy, I would be happy to know.

Because .validate() is only the initialization method of the plugin, it is not the testing method.  The .validate() method only gets called once on DOM ready to initialize the plugin with your rules &amp; options.  All subsequent calls are ignored.

You would use the .valid() method to programmatically trigger a validation test on demand.

Your code should look more like this...

$(document).ready(function() {

    $('form#myForm').validate({ // initialize the plugin
        // rules &amp; options
    });

","Your problem is here:

Because .validate() is only the initialization method of the plugin, it is not the testing method.  The .validate() method only gets called once on DOM ready to initialize the plugin with your rules &amp; options.  All subsequent calls are ignored.

You would use the .valid() method to programmatically trigger a validation test on demand.

Your code should look more like this...

$(document).ready(function() {

    $('form#myForm').validate({ // initialize the plugin
        // rules &amp; options
    });

    $('div.nextStepBilling').click(function (e) {

In people's experience - does it make it easier for the resistance?
","I would agree that it makes the game slightly easier for the resistance side, but as a comment mentions it can vary a lot depending on the play style of the group.

In my experience and opinion, it makes the game more strategic and interesting. Since it provides some extra information, allows for a better focusing of the speculation and decision making processes.

After discovering the expansion, I wouldn't play without it unless I'm teaching new people how to play thus making an exception for the first game.

  What are the characteristics of a ""modern design""? Conversely what
  are the tell tale signs of a ""dated"" design?


For reference, here is the latest iteration of my design. Does it still look ""dated""? If so, what elements give that impression?





I think I am starting to get a better idea of what ""modern web design"" is:


No or light gradients
Sans serif typefaces
Light drop shadows
Good page hierarchy / directing visitor's attention


Is there anything else that makes a design look ""modern""? 

I have implemented the most of the recommendations in the answers, and I feel it has improved the design a lot. (Never mind the logo - will figure that one out later) 



Am I still stuck in the past? Or am I finally getting somewhere?



Implementing all recommendations, this is what I get:


It's obviously much better, but is it up to modern standards yet? If not, can it get there without changing massively the layout? 



The learning process never ends, does it? Assume that the central menu has a lava effect and that hopefully I can get a decent photo of myself shot to replace that one.



Looking at the various versions, I can see the design improving by leaps and bounds. Not sure how much further it needs to improve to reach professional standards, but it's certainly moving in the right direction.

Thanks a lot to all of you. I am impressed by the quality of the advice and how specific and actionable most recommendations have been so far.
",Sylverdrag,https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/users/3392,"From my understanding of what you are asking it is very subjective to quantify a design as "" modern"".

Your website looks very plainly a very simplistic design (which is good thing) but is not appealing visually. You should try and change your layout, integrate your logo better into your site and also try to add an animated banner. Also the ""thanks a lot"" is a little old fashioned.

For some cool buttons see here  
For a menu bar that moves with the page scroll you can see this  
For a drop down menu you can see this  
You can make a slider/slideshow on your own or use software for it like SlideShowPro or a free one - WOW Slider.You can do all sorts of things with this - make it scrollable and in many cases its a good idea to link it to your menu bar. (See here for some inspiration)  
For smooth scrolling see this    


The rest really is upto you. Make good use of the Triptych part ... it can make your site go from cool to awesome (again see smooth scrolling - this is extremely handy). Use AJAX to make your site more dynamic (because modern designs won't just relate to the visual appeal of your website but also the interaction of your site with the viewer) (jQuery makes life simple here).

5279,5279,8386,How to encode factors as dummy variables when using stepPlr?,"When using the step.plr() function in the stepPlr package, if my predictors are factors, do I need to encode my predictors as dummy variables manually before passing it to the function? I do know that I can specify ""level"", but how  the ""level"" parameter works is confusing to me. 
My understanding is that I need to tell step.plr() explicitly which factors should be encoded as dummy variables and thus leaving one factor out intentionally. 

Let's consider a simple example. Suppose I have 1 categorical predicator with 4 levels and binary response. Normally, if I use glm() to fit a logistic regression model, glm() would automatically convert the categorical predicator into 3 dummy variables. Now in stepPlr(), do I specify the ""level"" parameter for that predictor with 4 levels or 3 levels? The ""Help"" section is vague, and says: 


  If the j-th column of x is discrete, level[[ j ]] is the set of levels for the categorical factor.


Does it mean I should tell step.plr() about all 4 levels, or I should make an intelligent decision myself and tell step.plr() to use only 3 levels? 

==============UPDATE (16 Oct 2012)=============

The following example will demonstrate what is the problem with step.plr()'s automatic dummy variable encoding. It is a slight modification of the code in the function's help section. 
     set.seed(100)

n &lt;- 100
p &lt;- 3
z &lt;- matrix(sample(seq(3),n*p,replace=TRUE),nrow=n)

                x3=factor(sample(seq(3), n, replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.2, 0.5, 0.3))),
                x4=factor(sample(seq(3), n, replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.1, 0.3, 0.6))))
y &lt;- sample(c(0,1),n,replace=TRUE)
fit &lt;- step.plr(x,y, cp=""aic"")
summary(fit)


And here's an excerpt of the result:

Call:
plr(x = ix0, y = y, weights = weights, offset.subset = offset.subset, 
    offset.coefficients = offset.coefficients, lambda = lambda, 
    cp = cp)

Coefficients:
      Estimate Std.Error z value Pr(&gt;|z|)
Intercept  0.91386   5.04780   0.181    0.856

You can see that all levels, that is, (1,2,3), are used to fit the model. But normally you only need two dummy variables to encode a predictor with 3 levels.
On the other hand, if you use glm(): 

glm(y~.^2, data=x, family=binomial)

5582,5582,8862,Mechanic says not to use top three/bottom two gears or the chain will throw,"I just bought a BTwin Fit 5, all stock, fresh from the distributor, Decathlon. Took it for light pacing at the store and things seemed OK. About 100 metres out the door, I shift up to the top end of the range, pedalling firmly but not hard, and it promptly throws the chain to the outside.

Returning to the store, the mechanic puts the chain back on, adjusts the tension on the derailleurs and tells me not to use the top three or bottom two gears (i.e., the 3 highest resistance and two lowest resistance shift positions in the drive train's range), or the chain will throw again. I asked why, but unfortunately, I'm a foreigner and don't speak the local language well enough to understand any of his explanation. Please note I definitely did not misunderstand the bit about not using the gears; this was crystal clear. 

Wild speculations on what he may have said about the reasons for this:


Chain tension or play due to the lateral shift between the inner and outer gears of the front and rear cassettes when shifting
Chain length
Something about the derailleurs


Again, there's a substantial language barrier and I have zero confidence in my understanding of what he said about why I shouldn't use those gears.

If you're not familiar with Decathlon, it's a sports department/box/super store. Definitely not a high end or dedicated bike shop. The house mechanic struck me as less than an expert, to put it gently. I've definitely read some reviews online griping about the inability of Decathlon staff to correctly set up the drive trains of new bikes. However, it's important to understand that this quality of expertise is representative of (or better than) that of every shop within an hour's travel.

This advice seems utterly mad to me. What on earth could be the reasoning behind this? What can I do about it?

Took it for light pacing at the store and things seemed OK. About 100 metres out the door, I shift up to the top end of the range, pedalling firmly but not hard, and it promptly throws the chain to the outside.

Returning to the store, the mechanic puts the chain back on, adjusts the tension on the derailleurs and tells me not to use the top three or bottom two gears (i.e., the 3 highest resistance and two lowest resistance shift positions in the drive train's range), or the chain will throw again. I asked why, but unfortunately, I'm a foreigner and don't speak the local language well enough to understand any of his explanation. Please note I definitely did not misunderstand the bit about not using the gears; this was crystal clear. 

Wild speculations on what he may have said about the reasons for this:


Chain tension or play due to the lateral shift between the inner and outer gears of the front and rear cassettes when shifting
Chain length
Something about the derailleurs


Again, there's a substantial language barrier and I have zero confidence in my understanding of what he said about why I shouldn't use those gears.

If you're not familiar with Decathlon, it's a sports department/box/super store. Definitely not a high end or dedicated bike shop. The house mechanic struck me as less than an expert, to put it gently. I've definitely read some reviews online griping about the inability of Decathlon staff to correctly set up the drive trains of new bikes. However, it's important to understand that this quality of expertise is representative of (or better than) that of every shop within an hour's travel.

This advice seems utterly mad to me. What on earth could be the reasoning behind this? What can I do about it? Aside from the obvious of taking it to a better mechanic, as that presents substantial difficulty for me on a number of fronts. The bike shifts without a problem, including before the throw.

I was 100% convinced that I received the dissertation in error (also because the mailing was addressed to my name, but using a wrong department name).

Last week I by chance got hold of the graduate and told him that he sent me his thesis by accident, and asked whether he wants to have it back.

So, is this a thing, at least in some fields? If so, why not just send the core papers or a link to a digital version of the thesis? Mailing out printed copies seems extremely expensive, and also (at least for me) very unlikely to result in anything else than me having another book gathering dust in my office shelf.

3851,3851,6122,What are the chances of something *not* occurring?,"Suppose I'm gambling using a strategy of doubling my bet whenever I lose to recoup my losses from previous bets. If my initial bet is 1/2048 of my capital, I can bet 10 times before I run out of money. Statistics says that the chances of this happening are ~1/718. As the law of large numbers states, though, this is in no way a guarantee that such an outcome will manifest in any certain number of iterations.

Is it possible, therefore, to calculate the chances that this doesn't happen? For example, is there an equation we can put x (the number of bets) into and determine the likelihood of this 1/718 chance not occurring? My chances of losing within the first ten bets would be extremely small, and my chances after ten thousand would be pretty high, so is there any way to calculate the middle ground?

I'm pretty sure the law of numbers doesn't actually state what you say it does. (The claim is nevertheless true, though - it's not certain at any finite $n$.)
$P(E)+P(\overline{E})=1$ (where $\overline{E}$ is the complement of $E$, or  'not-$E$'). So if the 1/718 chance of losing it all in ten bets was accurate, then the chance of not losing it all in ten bets is $1-\frac{_1}{^{718}}$.

As far as I know, there is only one way to prove that those sysadmins definitely have not read the plaintext of those files:


Never send the plaintext of those files directly to the host. Bob always encrypts each file before he sends it to the host.
Never send the file decryption key to the host. (Except perhaps in encrypted form, encrypted by some other key that is never sent in plaintext to the host server).


One way to do that is for Bob to generate encrypted files in OpenPGP format, and send those encrypted files to the host server.
(At the time of encryption, Bob uses his own public key and Alice's public key, in order to generate a file that can only be decrypted using either his own corresponding private key, or Alice's corresponding private key).
OpenPGP includes a message authentication code that can be used to prove that the sysadmins definitely have not modified the files, or replaced them entirely with files they created.

I finally got Windows 7 set up how I like it and decided on a suite of software that I will be installing after each format. Since I tested a bunch of programs and the Windows installation is full of Junk, a clean install is needed. After I reinstall Win7 along with all the other software, I want to make a Drive Image so I can at any time go back to that exact setup. In the past I used Clonezilla. I would have it backup the entire drive, compress it, and then transfer it to a network store. This process is a pain in the butt though. It also ends up taking up too much space since Clonezilla uses dd and dd does not care what filesystem you are using. It makes a copy of the drive sector by sector. It doesn't know where a file ends or free space begins. This is what I am looking for this time around... (I don't care if its Open Source or Commercial, although free alternatives are always nice).


Does not include Unused Space in the drive image
Backs up the MBR and any other absolutely necessary information so the system goes back to exactly the way it was when it was backed up. I don't want to be worried that I have to repair the MBR or deal with other booting issues.
Can write the image to multiple DVDs AND to a network share. This means that it has to be able to split the backup.
Does not need Windows to work. It has a bootable disc version of the program in case I can't get into Windows and need to restore the backup.
Preferably makes the initial backup DVD (Disc 1) also the boot disc. So I can insert disc 1 into the computer, restart, and it will allow me to begin restoring the image to the drive. It would only ask for Disc 2 after it restored everything from the disc it booted from.
Loads itself into RAM, does not need to have the disc in the drive to function.
Supports NTFS (This should be pretty obvious).
Allows me to view the image file in a file editor and make changes in case I want to add/remove anything. (I don't care if this is only possible on the single file Network Backup and I have to recreate the DVDs. The bootable version does not need this).
I am going to be using this software only to image the drive. It will not be my daily/weekly/monthly backup solution. Therefore I don't want the imaging to force me into some backup schedule. If I have to force it to not make automatic backups after the initial image, I don't want it.

59,59,91,can I use a disk larger than 320 GB with RPi?,"I have a 500GB Toshiba 2.5' HD, which I formated using Debian Wheezy 64bit. I created 2 partitions (180GB and 320GB).
RPi would only recognize the first partition. 

So, I tried creating the partitions using the raspberrypi. Here are my surprising findings:

root@raspberrypi:/home/ozn# fdisk -l

/dev/mmcblk0p2          122880     7862271     3869696   83  Linux

255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 38913 cylinders, total 625142448 sectors
Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes

First, /dev/sda is NOT recognized correctly! This disk is 500GB. 

Second, mounting /dev/sda2 is not possible:

root@raspberrypi:/home/ozn# mount -t ext4 /dev/sda2 /media/usbhdd1/
mount: special device /dev/sda2 does not exist
# although fdisk -l showed this device !


Third, trying to format the disk, it really sees only the sectors until 320GB:
When I start fdisk I am warned:

Building a new DOS disklabel with disk identifier 0x6784fc4b.
Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
After that, of course, the previous content won't be recoverable.

Warning: invalid flag 0x0000 of partition table 4 will be corrected by w(rite)

Command (m for help): w
The partition table has been altered!

Calling ioctl() to re-read partition table.
Syncing disks.


I have other USB hard drives with 320GB and they really mount fine. 


Is this a limitation of RPi? Or a problem with this specific Hard Drive?   
How can I use this large disk with my RPi? 


update: solved the issue with help of the commentators here...

here is what I did ...


I thought I have some weired issue with Debian Wheezy &amp; gparted. So, I reformatted the hard drive to NTFS. Before that I ERASED the partition table. 
And created a new single NTFS partition. 
Bingo! RPi, identified the partition. However, it claimed my Drive is now 2TB big, and recommended I will use GPT:

whoops! That is WRONG!

So, I disconnected the hard drive again. re-connented it to my laptop. I erased the partition table again, and re-created the partition table using fdisk on RPi! not on my laptop! This time, I took a short cut, and created the disk partition with ext4 directly. 
    I plugged the hard-drive to RPi and BINGO!

conclusion (?)

My guess is that gparted in Debian Wheezy includes some nasty bug which is sometimes showing it's ugly face. I would report a bug if I had more solid evidence. But ... since I have only one 500GB hard drive, and I don't want to
risk the health of this hard drive reformatting it so many time, I will settle this with it. If you happen to bump into this post, and you have had similar problems with large SATA drives and partitioning on wheezy, I would be happy to know.

So, I tried creating the partitions using the raspberrypi. Here are my surprising findings:

First, /dev/sda is NOT recognized correctly! This disk is 500GB. 

Second, mounting /dev/sda2 is not possible:

root@raspberrypi:/home/ozn# mount -t ext4 /dev/sda2 /media/usbhdd1/
mount: special device /dev/sda2 does not exist
# although fdisk -l showed this device !


Third, trying to format the disk, it really sees only the sectors until 320GB:

I have other USB hard drives with 320GB and they really mount fine. 


Is this a limitation of RPi? Or a problem with this specific Hard Drive?   
How can I use this large disk with my RPi?

3022,3022,4816,25V for PMOS switch VGS?,"In a load supply using P-MOS, the input to source is 25V. We found unfortunately that the MOSFET we chose and soldered has only 20V maximum gate-source voltage. Although there are voltage dividers consisting of R1 and R2, we are not sure upon the sudden turning on of NMOS, whether VGS could temporarily reach 25V, and whether the P-MOSFET Q1 could stand it.
We haven’t yet found MOSFETs having rated VGS>20V yet.
Questions:



http://www.diodes.com/datasheets/ZXMP6A17G.pdf


Could someone recommend PMOS having larger maximum VGS?
The application of using PMOS for high voltage switch should be common and VCC=25V is unlikely to be at the high end of typical applications. So how do applications typically handle voltage exceeding maximum VGS?


Matt
",Matt Mitchell,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/71078,"We can make this work well for you.
But attention must be given to the changes required. 

You are trying to use the transistor in an unnecessary mode in order to attempt to eliminate a very common design requirement which simply needs to be faced.

ie you do not ""need"" a higher Vgs FEt - you just need to drive an otherwise suitable FET correctly by limiting Vgsmax to a voltage which is enough to drive the FET correctly worst case -but still less or much less than Vgs_absmax. 

In addition, you need to specify switching speed requirements and address them explicitly as part of your design. 

You ask (in a comment) ""If we are using the PMOS for fast switching applications (~10μs),..."" -> if you are using timings of the order of 10 uS (and you do not give any indication of switching speeds in your question) then the passive 30k R1 resistor is going to utterly mangle your switching waveforms. Without looking at the datasheet you can use a rule of thumb gate capacitance of 1 nF. That with 30k Rgs for turn off gives a time constant of 30 microseconds. Zener response times are far from your greatest problem.

Vgsmax of the MOSFET only needs to be safely greater than the maximum Vgs you need for full enhancement of the MOSFET under the worst case conditions of interest.
Very few MOSFETS need more than 12V Vgs to be driven as hard as is possible, so a Vgsmax rating of 20V is very acceptable.
By making R1 = R2 you reduce Vgsmax to about 12.5V. 

Looks at data sheet ...

VGs of 10V (actually -10V) is the maximum you need to fully drive the FET worst case.
Gate capacitance appears to be comfortable under 1 nF.
Better - use the gate charge curve at top right of page 6 to see what gate current you will need to remove the gate charge at the Vgs you wish to work at.
Note that they only specify Vgs up to 10V on this graph, and that gate charge is substantially higher at high Vgs levels.  

""At a guesstimate"", using 1k for R1 and R2 would probably achieve switching that is in the order of fast enough, and Vgsmax can probably be less than 10V allowing even smaller R1 - so lower RC time constant and less charge to remove as well.

It's not a marvellous GET - Rdson is 125 milliOhm typical at 10V Vgs, ~= 4A, 25 C. That mans you would get about 4 x 125 = 500 milliOhms Rds at 4A. That may be acceptable, but much better is possible at modest cost. 



To design this driver possible we need to know:

Maximum switched current.
Switch timing waveforms - on or off for how long?, what rise &amp; fall times needed and why?
What is the load? (resistive, inductive, heated filament, ...?)
Anything else important that will change the question when we know about it.



Note that FET gate voltages want to be kept well away from Vgs_abs_max. The gate to channel interface is an oxide layer whose thickness is measurable in ""atoms thick"" and can be broken down by a whiff of overvoltage if unprotected. Driving with say 10V abs max and then providing a say 12V or 15V reverse biased zener connected gate to source and physically close to the FET.

We found unfortunately that the MOSFET we chose and soldered has only 20V maximum gate-source voltage. Although there are voltage dividers consisting of R1 and R2, we are not sure upon the sudden turning on of NMOS, whether VGS could temporarily reach 25V, and whether the P-MOSFET Q1 could stand it.
We haven’t yet found MOSFETs having rated VGS>20V yet.
Questions:



http://www.diodes.com/datasheets/ZXMP6A17G.pdf


Could someone recommend PMOS having larger maximum VGS?
The application of using PMOS for high voltage switch should be common and VCC=25V is unlikely to be at the high end of typical applications. So how do applications typically handle voltage exceeding maximum VGS?

","We can make this work well for you.
But attention must be given to the changes required. 

You are trying to use the transistor in an unnecessary mode in order to attempt to eliminate a very common design requirement which simply needs to be faced.

ie you do not ""need"" a higher Vgs FEt - you just need to drive an otherwise suitable FET correctly by limiting Vgsmax to a voltage which is enough to drive the FET correctly worst case -but still less or much less than Vgs_absmax. 

In addition, you need to specify switching speed requirements and address them explicitly as part of your design. 

You ask (in a comment) ""If we are using the PMOS for fast switching applications (~10μs),..."" -> if you are using timings of the order of 10 uS (and you do not give any indication of switching speeds in your question) then the passive 30k R1 resistor is going to utterly mangle your switching waveforms. Without looking at the datasheet you can use a rule of thumb gate capacitance of 1 nF. That with 30k Rgs for turn off gives a time constant of 30 microseconds. Zener response times are far from your greatest problem.

Vgsmax of the MOSFET only needs to be safely greater than the maximum Vgs you need for full enhancement of the MOSFET under the worst case conditions of interest.
Very few MOSFETS need more than 12V Vgs to be driven as hard as is possible, so a Vgsmax rating of 20V is very acceptable.
By making R1 = R2 you reduce Vgsmax to about 12.5V. 

Looks at data sheet ...

VGs of 10V (actually -10V) is the maximum you need to fully drive the FET worst case.
Gate capacitance appears to be comfortable under 1 nF.
Better - use the gate charge curve at top right of page 6 to see what gate current you will need to remove the gate charge at the Vgs you wish to work at.
Note that they only specify Vgs up to 10V on this graph, and that gate charge is substantially higher at high Vgs levels.  

""At a guesstimate"", using 1k for R1 and R2 would probably achieve switching that is in the order of fast enough, and Vgsmax can probably be less than 10V allowing even smaller R1 - so lower RC time constant and less charge to remove as well.

It's not a marvellous GET - Rdson is 125 milliOhm typical at 10V Vgs, ~= 4A, 25 C. That mans you would get about 4 x 125 = 500 milliOhms Rds at 4A. That may be acceptable, but much better is possible at modest cost. 



To design this driver possible we need to know:

Maximum switched current.
Switch timing waveforms - on or off for how long?, what rise &amp; fall times needed and why?
What is the load? (resistive, inductive, heated filament, ...?)
Anything else important that will change the question when we know about it.



Note that FET gate voltages want to be kept well away from Vgs_abs_max. The gate to channel interface is an oxide layer whose thickness is measurable in ""atoms thick"" and can be broken down by a whiff of overvoltage if unprotected. Driving with say 10V abs max and then providing a say 12V or 15V reverse biased zener connected gate to source and physically close to the FET. With a load with any inductance, adding this zener  may transform reliability. This is because Millar coupling from Drain to gate can otherwise wreak overvoltage havoc on the gate oxide.

2365,2365,3771,Is it usual for finished PhD students to send out physical copies of their thesis to unknown persons?,"Some time ago, a recently-graduated PhD has sent me a physical (book) copy of his dissertation. The graduate works in a somewhat-related field, but is personally entirely unknown to me (I have some loose connections to the advisor, though). I was reasonably confused by this - I personally have never heard of a custom of sending physical theses to anybody besides maybe parents. I was 100% convinced that I received the dissertation in error (also because the mailing was addressed to my name, but using a wrong department name).

Last week I by chance got hold of the graduate and told him that he sent me his thesis by accident, and asked whether he wants to have it back. He seemed confused and a little bit annoyed that I wanted to give his thesis back - it turns out he actually sent me the book on purpose, assuming that I would be interested in his work. He told me that he thought it is customary to send a finished PhD thesis to people that he thought might profit from its results.

So, is this a thing, at least in some fields? If so, why not just send the core papers or a link to a digital version of the thesis? Mailing out printed copies seems extremely expensive, and also (at least for me) very unlikely to result in anything else than me having another book gathering dust in my office shelf. I am honestly very unlikely to read an entire thesis, especially if I only have it in a dead-tree book version.

More recently (in the past few years), I believe a lot of universities have switched to electronic archival of theses, which means the campus library no longer requires a printed copy.

My thought process was that I create the sub-pages, then create a new type of content (with the cck) where I can add the new sub-page node names and their links.
I created the new content type with two fields. field_offeringlink and field_offeringtext. Where the the text would be the actuall promotional text and the link directing to the sub-page.
After this I wanted to create a Block that I would place on the front page, showing these two fields.

I have a site where I would like to add a new block to the front page of the website. This block would show the companies newest available training's. I created the sub-pages of the training's.
My thought process was that I create the sub-pages, then create a new type of content (with the cck) where I can add the new sub-page node names and their links.
I created the new content type with two fields. field_offeringlink and field_offeringtext. Where the the text would be the actuall promotional text and the link directing to the sub-page.
After this I wanted to create a Block that I would place on the front page, showing these two fields.
I couldn't figure out this part...
So how do I make the bloody block show my fields?

OR

If you have a better idea for this whole shannanigan then I am welcome to ideas.

My goal:

Create a dynamic block on the front page, that shows all the latest training's. Under dynamic I mean, that we can add-remove the links from the admin/content menu.

Thanks in advance!
","You want to create a content type for Training. Then you can add Fields for things like start and end dates, registration deadlines, difficulty ratings, whatever.

Then you want to have a View that exposes a Block, for content type Training. The view shows the 5 (or however many) newest Training nodes that you've created. You can accomplish all this on the first, 'easy' page when you create the new view.

Also, since you used Views, you can then move on to, for instance, showing only Trainings whose registration deadlines have not passed, and so forth.

But basically Views does all the heavy lifting. If you ever find yourself thinking: 'I need to make a page that lists all these nodes,' then what you really need is Views.

We store their certificates in database in Base64 string. Old code look like that:

//Store certificates
String certificateEncodeBase64 = Convert.ToBase64String(byteArrayCertificateFile);

//Verify signatures

//Hash algorithm SHA-1
HashAlgorithm hashAlgrothm = new SHA1Managed();

bool vr = pubKey.VerifyData(data, hashAlgrothm, signature);


Nothing issues except the performance is not good. That's why we want to move to new system using Java 1.7 (run on Windows Server 2012 64 bits). Our new code look like that:

//Using the same DB store certificates

//Verify signatures using Bouncy Castle JCE Provider

//Hash data using SHA-1

MessageDigest messageDigest_ = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-1"", ""BC"");

//Verify using algorithm RSA
Signature verifyEngine = Signature.getInstance(""RSA"", ""BC"");
verifyEngine.initVerify(certificate);
verifyEngine.update(hashed);

",Lê Đình Quang,https://stackoverflow.com/users/3395712,"I don't think you're using the correct signature algorithm. The documentation suggests that you should probably be using SHA1withRSA as the signature algorithm. This is further indicated by the signature vs. expected. The ""expected"" value you give is the raw SHA-1 hash, whereas the signature you're providing is a PKCS#1 v1.5 DigestInfo (See RFC2313, section 10.1.2).

When i is luvut.Length - 1, then i + 1 will be luvut.Length - and therefore an invalid index. (For an array of length x, the valid indexes are 0 to x - 1 inclusive.) You probably want to end one iteration earlier:

"
1601,1601,2517,Is conditional compilation a valid mock/stub strategy for unit testing?,"In a recent question on stubbing, many answers suggested C# interfaces or delegates for implementing stubs, but one answer suggested using conditional compilation, retaining static binding in the production code.  This answer was modded -2 at the time of reading, so at least 2 people really thought this was a wrong answer.  Perhaps misuse of DEBUG was the reason, or perhaps use of fixed value instead of more extensive validation.  But I can't help wondering:

Is the use of conditional compilation an inappropriate technique for implementing unit test stubs?  Sometimes?  Always?

Thanks.

Edit-add:  I'd like to add an example as a though experiment:

class Foo {
    public Foo() { .. }
    private DateTime Now { 
      get {
#if UNITTEST_Foo
        return Stub_DateTime.Now;
#else
        return DateTime.Now;
#endif
      }
    }

This answer was modded -2 at the time of reading, so at least 2 people really thought this was a wrong answer.  Perhaps misuse of DEBUG was the reason, or perhaps use of fixed value instead of more extensive validation.  But I can't help wondering:

Is the use of conditional compilation an inappropriate technique for implementing unit test stubs?  Sometimes?  Always?

1275,1275,2009,How the hypergeometric distribution sums to 1?,"The hypergeometric distribution is defined for $\max(0, n+K-N)\leq k\leq \min(K,n).$
But, when we use Vandermonde's identity to prove that probabilities sum to $1$, then we use the range of $0\leq k \leq n.$ I wonder how this is justified?
",Silent,https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/30971,"The reference mentions that this identity is from combinatorics: that is, it counts things.  

What does it count?  Consider $N$ objects.  Once and for all, divide those $n$ things into a group of $K$ of them, which I will call ""red,"" and the remainder, which I will call ""blue.""  Each subset of $n$ such objects determines, and is determined by, its red objects and its blue objects.  The number of such sets with $k$ red objects (and therefore $n-k$ blue objects) equals the number of ways to choose $k$ red objects from all $K$ ones (written $\color{red}{\binom{K}{k}}$) times the number of ways to choose the remaining $n-k$ blue objects from all the $N-K$ ones (written $\color{blue}{\binom{N-K}{n-k}}$).

Now if $k$ is not between $0$ and $K$, then there is no $k$-element subset of $K$ things, so $\binom{K}{k}=0$ in such cases.  Similarly, $\binom{N-K}{n-k}=0$ if $n-k$ is not between $0$ and $N-K$.  (This not only makes sense, it is actually how good software will evaluate these quantities.  Ask R, for instance, to compute choose(5,6) or choose(5,-1): it will return the correct value of $0$ in both cases.)

Summing over all possible numbers $k$ shows that 

$$\binom{N}{n} = \sum_k \color{red}{\binom{K}{k}}\color{blue}{\binom{N-K}{n-k}}$$

and as you read this you should say to yourself ""any $n$ objects are comprised of some number $k$ of red objects and the remaining $n-k$ blue objects.""

The sum needs to include all $k$ for which both the terms $\color{red}{\binom{K}{k}}$ and $\color{blue}{\binom{N-K}{n-k}}$ are nonzero, but it's fine to include any other values of $k$ because they will just introduce some extra zeros into the sum, which does not change it.  We just need to make sure all relevant $k$ are included. It suffices to find an obvious lower bound for it ($0$ will do nicely and is more practicable than $-\infty$!) and an obvious upper bound ($N$ works because we cannot find more than $N$ objects altogether).  A slightly better upper bound is $n$ (because $k$ counts the red objects in a set of $n$ things).  Thus, writing these bounds explicitly and dividing both sides by $\binom{N}{n}$, we obtain

$$1 = \sum_{0\le k\le n}\frac{\color{red}{\binom{K}{k}}\color{blue}{\binom{N-K}{n-k}}}{\binom{N}{n}} .$$

Despite the notation, this formula does not implicitly assert that all values of $k$ in the range from $0$ to $n$ can occur in this distribution.  About the only reason to fiddle with the inequalities and figure out what the smallest possible range of $k$ can be would be for writing programs that loop over these values: that might save a little time adding up some zeros.

2555,2555,4067,Derivative of Continuous and Differentiable Piecewise function is indeterminate,"I'm attempting to analytically stitch together two linear functions with two quadratic functions. The function I'm considering, then, is a piecewise function consisting of 4 parts. Below are the values I'm considering for the scenario as well as the function itself. 

k1 = 1.41; k2 = 1.45; eps1 = 2*^8; eps2 = 3.5*^8; p0 = 1.04*^8; delP = 0.01*^8;
kmax = (1/2)(k1 + k2) + (k2 p0 + eps2 - k1 p0 - eps1)/delP;

This function is continuous and differentiable at the boundary points, which you can see by plotting it:

Plot[edens[p], {p, p0 - 2*delP, p0 + 2*delP}, Exclusions -&gt; None]




However, if I try and evaluate the derivative of this function at the boundary points (p0, p0-delP, and p0+delP), I get Indeterminate even though the value is the same on both sides.

I have a feeling this is because I'm using approximate real numbers. Is there anyway to force Mathematica to say that the derivative at a boundary point is a specific value?

The function I'm considering, then, is a piecewise function consisting of 4 parts. Below are the values I'm considering for the scenario as well as the function itself. 

k1 = 1.41; k2 = 1.45; eps1 = 2*^8; eps2 = 3.5*^8; p0 = 1.04*^8; delP = 0.01*^8;

This function is continuous and differentiable at the boundary points, which you can see by plotting it:

Plot[edens[p], {p, p0 - 2*delP, p0 + 2*delP}, Exclusions -&gt; None]




However, if I try and evaluate the derivative of this function at the boundary points (p0, p0-delP, and p0+delP), I get Indeterminate even though the value is the same on both sides.

I have a feeling this is because I'm using approximate real numbers. Is there anyway to force Mathematica to say that the derivative at a boundary point is a specific value?
","You may define:

deriv[fun_, pp_] := Limit[D[fun[p], p], p -&gt; pp]
deriv[edens, p0]

In fact, this way you can also obtain a symbolic form for the derivative

Clear[k1, k2, eps1, eps2, p0, delP, kmax];
deriv[edens, p] // InputForm
(* Piecewise[{{k1, delP + p - p0 &lt;= 0},

For postfix, for example, scripts run from /etc/aliases (or any other root-owned aliases file) will be run as the 'nobody' user.

if you ever need to run a script from mail as root, then the easiest way (if you have sudo installed) is to configure sudo to allow 'nobody' to run it as root without a password and run it from a wrapper script that runs it with sudo.

NOTE: whenever triggering scripts from mail, you have to remember that the data (i.e. the mail) is from an untrusted source (the internet)....so it is extremely unsafe to use the data from either the body or the header as arguments to commands executed by the script.  this is basically the same issue as trusting user-supplied data in a CGI script - just don't do it.  e.g. consider what a badly written script could do if the user-supplied data was something like "" ... innocuousdatahere ...; rm -rf /"".  you might think it would be easy to check for obvious things like semi-colons and strip them out, but there's a lot of non-obvious things you'd need to check for as well and you'd just be setting yourself up for a failure since you're unlikely to think of or catch them all.  far safer to eliminate the security risk entirely by just not trusting user supplied data ever.

",John,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/8745,"Particles in the standard model are in principle massless and acquire mass through interactions via the Lagrangian.

  DirectX Error when Installing: When installing the game if you get an error that DirectX9.0c is not installed, even if you've installed DX9.0c already, then find the game's Autorun.exe file (in the base directory of the game CD), right-click on it, select Properties, go to the Compatibility tab, tick the 'Run this program in compatibility mode for' and select 'Windows 2000'. Then double-click on Autorun.exe to begin installation. Make sure to turn off compatibility mode after installing the game.


If this doesn't fix your problem, you're going to have to provide more detail in your question.

2725,2725,4342,What's the base f-stop when counting an ideal f-stop for lens?,"I've read a lot around this site that an ideal quality of the lens is achieved when using f-stop roughly 2 stops slower than the fastest value of the lens.

Firstly, I'm not exactly sure what ""2 stops"" mean when it comes to f-stop, but this isn't really important in what I'm about to ask. What I'd like to know is what is the base f-stop when counting this value.

Let's look at it this way: If I have a prime lens with f/1.8, then obviously I'll be getting the ideal value from f/1.8, let's say after 2 stops I get f/2.8?

But! What in case of zoom lenses, for example 18-55, which have f-stop f/3.5 - f/5.6. Should I take f/5.6 as my base value, or does the base value depends on the real fastest value at the exact focal length?

Therefore, if I set the lens to 18 mm, their fastest aperture is f/3.5 and thus the ideal quality is at f/5.6 and when I set it to 55 mm, their fastest aperture is f/5.6 and thus the ideal quality is at f/8 ? Or is it f/8 for the whole focal range ?
",Richard Rodriguez,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/4822,"Real fastest value at the exact focal length.

But, this is just a rule of thumb — it's not necessarily exactly two stops in every case.

For the question of what two stops mean, see What does f-stop mean?. In short, each stop is approximately the-square-root-of-two times the previous one. That means half the light is allowed in (which is why the seemingly-weird series of numbers was chosen). Two stops is doing that twice, which conveniently works out to simply being doubling. Two stops from f/2 is f/4, and and two stops from that is f/8. Or, starting at f/1.8, two stops is f/3.6.

The test results comparison tool used by Digital Photography Review is interesting for looking at this. Try this test of Pentax's 18-55mm zoom, which like most kit zooms goes from f/3.5 at the short end to f/5.6 zoomed out.

You can see that at 18mm, the sharpness improves as you go from f/3.5 to f/4 to f/5.6. At f/8, it's more even from center to corners, but doesn't get any sharper. And beyond that, it drops off.

Then, change the focal length to 55mm. You'll notice that with this lens, overall sharpness goes down from 18mm at f/5.6. At f/8, it picks up a little bit, and a little more at f/11, and then back down again at f/16.

So, that fits with the two-stops guideline pretty well. Same for the Canon kit lens, and Nikon too.

With the Pentax DA 15mm f/4 Limited test, they've got test results in third-stops, and there you can see that f/7.1 is no better than f/6.3, and f/8 is worse — so that's only 1⅓ stops. On the other hand the DA★ 55mm f/1.4 shows peak sharpness at f/4.5 — closed down by 3⅓ stops. This doesn't reflect a problem with the lens, just different priorities in design. The Nikon 50mm f/1.4G is similar, with peak sharpness at 3⅔ or 4 stops down. However, the entry level Nikkor f/1.8G fits the ""two stops"" guide quite well, peaking at around f/3.5.

It's also worth noting that this test is primarily concerned with sharpness, because that's easy to measure. Other image quality and rendering characteristics are also affected. Vignetting (light falloff in the corners) gets better the more you stop down, and it's usually gone after two stops. And bokeh quality is usually improved by stopping down, too — generally, lens bokeh is nicer/smoother stopped down a bit, but of course it's less visible since you have greater depth of field. Plus, shape of the aperture blades will become visible in specular highlights, which is a side-effect unrelated to stopping down per se — some modern lenses have rounded aperture blades to make that not be a concern.

Therefore, if I set the lens to 18 mm, their fastest aperture is f/3.5 and thus the ideal quality is at f/5.6 and when I set it to 55 mm, their fastest aperture is f/5.6 and thus the ideal quality is at f/8 ? Or is it f/8 for the whole focal range ?
","Real fastest value at the exact focal length.

But, this is just a rule of thumb — it's not necessarily exactly two stops in every case.

For the question of what two stops mean, see What does f-stop mean?. In short, each stop is approximately the-square-root-of-two times the previous one. That means half the light is allowed in (which is why the seemingly-weird series of numbers was chosen). Two stops is doing that twice, which conveniently works out to simply being doubling. Two stops from f/2 is f/4, and and two stops from that is f/8. Or, starting at f/1.8, two stops is f/3.6.

The test results comparison tool used by Digital Photography Review is interesting for looking at this. Try this test of Pentax's 18-55mm zoom, which like most kit zooms goes from f/3.5 at the short end to f/5.6 zoomed out.

You can see that at 18mm, the sharpness improves as you go from f/3.5 to f/4 to f/5.6. At f/8, it's more even from center to corners, but doesn't get any sharper. And beyond that, it drops off.

Then, change the focal length to 55mm. You'll notice that with this lens, overall sharpness goes down from 18mm at f/5.6. At f/8, it picks up a little bit, and a little more at f/11, and then back down again at f/16.

So, that fits with the two-stops guideline pretty well. Same for the Canon kit lens, and Nikon too.

With the Pentax DA 15mm f/4 Limited test, they've got test results in third-stops, and there you can see that f/7.1 is no better than f/6.3, and f/8 is worse — so that's only 1⅓ stops. On the other hand the DA★ 55mm f/1.4 shows peak sharpness at f/4.5 — closed down by 3⅓ stops. This doesn't reflect a problem with the lens, just different priorities in design. The Nikon 50mm f/1.4G is similar, with peak sharpness at 3⅔ or 4 stops down. However, the entry level Nikkor f/1.8G fits the ""two stops"" guide quite well, peaking at around f/3.5.

It's also worth noting that this test is primarily concerned with sharpness, because that's easy to measure. Other image quality and rendering characteristics are also affected. Vignetting (light falloff in the corners) gets better the more you stop down, and it's usually gone after two stops. And bokeh quality is usually improved by stopping down, too — generally, lens bokeh is nicer/smoother stopped down a bit, but of course it's less visible since you have greater depth of field. Plus, shape of the aperture blades will become visible in specular highlights, which is a side-effect unrelated to stopping down per se — some modern lenses have rounded aperture blades to make that not be a concern.

lemme explain in a simple way..

For my messaging app, I have 2 tables


Contacts - contains name, and phone number (currently 5,000+ records)
Messages - messages and the phone number, but not the name of the member


I need to list 1000 Messages, w/ the corresponding phone number and name if possible...

eg.


""Hi dude"" - from 565-1111 (John)
""Bring Cheese"" - from 565-2222 (Bieber)
""Hehehe "" - from 565-2332
""iron man is cool!"" - from 565-7748 (Arnie)


etc...

I would normally join contacts to messages via the phone number... pretty standard stuff...
(but in reality my queries are a bit more complex than a simple left join)

Now, i've been playing around w/ the idea of fetching all contacts and putting it into an array where my app/system could use it in a much easier , more straight forward and cleaner code... where:


query SELECT * contacts


and store them into an array:

contacts['555-7748'] = ""John"";
contacts['555-1111'] = ""Joe"";
contacts['555-2233'] = ""Borat"";
contacts['555-4234'] = ""Arnie"";
etc


this way i can easily lookup the NAME of the Contact via accessing the array, many times in my page/script, just by simply doing:

$name = contacts[$phoneNumber];


I have actually implemented this and it's really cool .. no more join headaches and re-querying contacts table etc.. 

now the question is.. is this OK? Practical? or could i be hitting some memory cap or something here? 

it's basically running JOIN query on EACH message my script outputs
or
store ALL THE CONTACTS/RECORDS into array (memory) and refer to that instead, making queries are more simple.. 
my only worry is, querying thousands of records into an array, may be a bit too much? or is this really OK/practical? specially since there are times when my script needs to fetch specific contacts more than once...

To add, I was also thinking of storing that array into a Session variable! lolz.. so my scripts can simply share this data.. lol 

looking forward to some good inputs
Thanks guys.



---- UPDATE as of 03-31-2013 (Sunday)  ----



Ok... I'm thinking about a totally different approach now..

1) SINCE all this is really me needing  to show the ""CONTACT NAME"" for each message for neat/presentation purposes (better to see the name of the contact on a message rather than phone number yeh?) .... 

2) and since each message will need to show 2 contact names  (receiver and sender) based on their phone numbers on the MESSAGES table..... 

3) I now am thinking of ADDING 2 fields into the MESSAGES table instead... ""sender_name"" and ""receiver_name"" ..  I have seen Bulletin board / Forum software use this technique a lot ..

4) when system receives a message , it checks for existing Contacts entry of the numbers associated w/ the message...and if it exists, get the respective names and include it into storage/insert 

5) ..problem is if during the message was received, contact info isnt available, so no NAMES are saved.. and later CONTACT info is then created... the OLD messages wont show the contact names as intended... 

6) 3 way solution... 1st, evertime a new contact is added/changed my php will make updates to all messages w/ the matching numbers... 2nd, from time to time perhaps once / month, run a ""synchronize routine"" to make sure things are in sync..  or, when a user Actually OPENS a message, mandatory routine will run to check if contact name of that particular message is still in sync w/ the contacts table information... and make updates as necessary.. 

hmmm... better approach you thing? this way, i just need to issue straight forward SELECT queries , simple, fast.. but am able to display the names.. 

then again, i still kinda find that QUICK array reference thing so cool though.. lolz

4668,4668,7395,Retirement Funds: Betterment vs Vanguard Life strategy vs Target Retirement,"I'm a 20 something grad student and would like to open a hands off retirement account with beta exposure to the market and would make monthly contributions. I'm fairly illiterate when it comes to investing, and the betterment account seems so user friendly. However, I realize it is a more expensive fund. Being that I can do math, I realize these fees add up over time. However, I like that betterment re-balances it self and I really like that it allows one to easily change the allocation of stocks and bonds. I know I said I wanted a hands off account, but what if the stock market crashes and I want to allocate more to bonds??? Does Vanguard re-balance and allow you to reallocate?

So far, I'm am leaning towards Vanguard? Does Betterment have advantages? Which Vanguard fund is more appropriate for a hands off investment account for retirement?  Both Vanguard accounts (Life strategy vs Target retirement) seem to have very similar fees and returns over the last 5 years. 
Thank you in advance.

I agree with JAGAnalyst - it's detrimental to your returns and potential for growth if you try to time the market.  That's why Betterment offers customized asset allocation for each portfolio based on the nature of your goal, time horizon, and how much you are able to put towards your investments.  We do this so regardless of what's happening in the markets, you can feel comfortable that your asset allocation plus other determining factors will get you where you need to go, without having to time your investing.  We also put out quite a bit of content regarding market timing and why we think it's an unwise practice.  We believe continuously depositing to your goal, especially through auto-deposits, compounding returns, tax-efficient auto-rebalancing, and reinvesting dividends are the best ways to grow your assets.

Let me know if you would like additional information regarding Betterment accounts and our best practices.  I am available at buck@betterment.com and am always happy to speak about Betterment's services.

",Bluefire,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/15851,"This is not an answer to your question but rather, additional information that may (or may not) be helpful in thinking about this kind of problem.

When I teach introductory circuit classes, I always emphasize the notion of duality which, when mastered, can give you deep insight into many fundamental ""rules"" of circuit analysis.

The idea is that if you know the answer for, say, a series circuit, you can take the dual of the result and get a correct answer for a seemingly very different problem.

So, here is short list of circuit duals:


  Voltage - Current
  
  Resistance - Conductance
  
  Inductance - Capacitance
  
  Impedance - Admittance
  
  Series - Parallel
  
  Thevenin - Norton


There are others but these will do most of the time.

Ohm's law is usually written as:

\$V = I R \$

To take the dual, replace all the variables in the above equation with their duals:

The dual of Ohm's Law:

\$I = VG \$

where \$G = \dfrac{1}{R} \$

Recall that for resistors in series, resistances add, so that the equivalent resistance is just the sum.

Consider the dual of this, conductances in parallel.

From the principle of duality, parallel conductances add just as series resistances.  So, if you have 3 conductances in parallel, the equivalent conductance is:

\$G_{eq} = G_1 + G_2 + G_3 \$

Now, convert back to resistance:

\$R_{eq} = \dfrac{1}{G_{eq}} = \dfrac{1}{G_1 + G_2 + G_3} = \dfrac{1}{\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2} +\frac{1}{R_3}}\$

In other words, the equivalent resistance of \$n\$ parallel resistors is the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals.

How can final variable change its value at the execution time, what the hell???
Actual value of variable is depend on value that I writing at sliders[i].setValue(4); But I don't know how exactly...

And I tried to set a watchpoint for this variable... Doesn't working. One time its zero and next time program stop in this for loop value is 9, 4 or whatever...

About the sight, I think our eyes use the parallax. But is this enough? Is this the only way we can perceive distances with them?

About the sounds, I think it is merely by interferometry, but I am not convinced, because the distances between our ears and the wavelength are not always comparable to one another.

What do you think about it?
Thanks in advance,

3669,3669,5851,magento creates two customer sessions with one browser for the same guest?,"I'm using Magento 1.7.0.2.
And I have the Problem to access customer session data I set in different controllers. 
I found out, that magento generates two session files (in var/session/) when I load two different controllers of my own modules
where I set data to the “customer/session”!
So when I load content over the one controller, then i get the one customer session data from the first session file and when i load an cms page or the other controller I get the data of the other session file! How can that be?
I’m using the same browser all the time. Why does magento think that there are two different users and generates two different customer session files when i load a different controller??? Additional I don’t work at this time with logged in customers...it’s all the time the guest customer session.

Has anybody any idea? 

UPDATE:

I checked the difference between the using of the different sessions by logging the session id and the differences of my controller classes.
I found out that I used in one controller the “_construct” function to set some helper variables. And when I removed this usage magento uses the other “correct” session. with the _construct it used the other session id.
But I don’t know why.

And I have the Problem to access customer session data I set in different controllers. 
I found out, that magento generates two session files (in var/session/) when I load two different controllers of my own modules
where I set data to the “customer/session”!
So when I load content over the one controller, then i get the one customer session data from the first session file and when i load an cms page or the other controller I get the data of the other session file! How can that be?
I’m using the same browser all the time. Why does magento think that there are two different users and generates two different customer session files when i load a different controller??? Additional I don’t work at this time with logged in customers...it’s all the time the guest customer session.

Has anybody any idea? 

UPDATE:

I checked the difference between the using of the different sessions by logging the session id and the differences of my controller classes.
I found out that I used in one controller the “_construct” function to set some helper variables. And when I removed this usage magento uses the other “correct” session. with the _construct it used the other session id.
But I don’t know why.
Has anybody an Idea? 
","If the wrong session is used, it is because the session_name is wrong. The session name is set in Mage_Core_Model_Session_Abstract_Varien::setSessionName().

My confusion is that i cannot seem to figure out how could I build independent DAOs for the STAR Dimensions and Facts tables which could then be swapped for a completely different model that might not even be table oriented (riak/mongo/whatever). 

Therefore,

Should I create DAOs which rather than abstracting the table, it abstracts the CRUD operations - for example create IDaoInsert which can then be implemented as SQLInsertDaoImpl and MongoInsertDaoImpl, each with a completely different model logic etc.

or

Should I just create the typical DAO design whose interface would be something like IDaoCustomerDimension, and the implementation SqlDaoCustomerDimesionImpl and MongoDaoCustomerDimentionImpl respectively?

Indeed, quite likely so, since there's an answer here that talks about TimBL while I'm going to talk about Mosaic, which was independent from him.

One stated reason for Mosaic choosing the colour, is that 4-bit colour was still common, and so designs would need to consider how well they would look on such displays. Most such displays used two sets of colours, one of which was of the sequence:

0) Black 1) Blue 2) Red 3) Magenta 4) Green 5) cyan 6) yellow 7) white

(Note the fun way the mixing of colours and adding of numbers has the same results).

Then there would be another set of the same colours, but lighter (sometimes ""light black"" would mean grey, sometimes ""dark white"" would mean grey, sometimes both).

Of this sequence, the colours were darkest to lightest in that order (still true of the equivalents in sRGB, NTSC and other richer colour-spaces, though the exact proportions are generally different). Indeed the scheme was designed so you could depend on different relative shades when used with a monochrome display (black and white, black and green or black and orange).

Hence the darkest colour other than black (already used for normal text) that therefore offered the next-greatest contrast against a white or (as used by said Mosaic browser) grey background, was blue. Hence what would later (when attributes for describing colours where added to HTML) be called #0000FF was the standard link colour. (#000080 would also have been available, but not as distinguished from the black of unlinked text).

Red is well-known as a means of emphasis, it would be an appropriate choice for an active link (and was used as such, though I'm pretty sure not until later on, with Netscape Navigator 2.0 if memory serves, since before &lt;frame&gt; and javascript an active link didn't mean much as the page was going to unload anyway), but inadvisable for a visited link, which if anything should be de-emphasised compared to unvisited. After red, the next brightest colour, and so the next most appropriate for text other than blue and black was magenta, but the darker #800080 (purple) was sufficiently different to both blue and black to be distinguished from them, and again the darker choice and hence that which stood out best against a light background.

5584,5584,8864,How to create an entity with a composite primary key containing a generated value,"Using Hibernate + annotations, I'm trying to do the following:

Two entities, Entity1 and Entity2.


Entity1 contains a simple generated value primary key.
Entity2 primary key is composed by a simple generated value + the id of entity one (with a many to one relationship)


Unfortunately, I can't make it work.

Here is an excerpt of the code:

@Entity
public class Entity1 {

 @Id @GeneratedValue
 private Long id;

 private String name;

    ...
}

@Entity
public class Entity2 {

 @EmbeddedId

 private Long id;

 @ManyToOne
 private Entity1 entity;
}

void test() {

    Entity1 e1 = new Entity1();
    e1.setName(""nameE1"");
    Entity2 e2 = new Entity2();

    e2.setEntity1(e1);
    e2.setMiscData(""test"");

4537,4537,7190,"What is the difference between ""Mongolian Grill"" and ""Hibachi""?","For years I have been frequenting Chinese restaurants that feature ""Mongolian Grill"" (or Mongolian BBQ depending on the location). Recently I tried a new place that had (what they called) ""Hibachi"", which looked very similar, and I originally mistook for 'the same'. When I inquired about the Mongolian grill I was informed that there is a difference.

Can someone clarify for me what the differences are?
",Cos Callis,https://cooking.stackexchange.com/users/6279,"Hibachi are technically a traditional Japanese device used for heating one's house.  They are a basic, heat-proof container that holds charcoal.



The cooking devices that many people refer to as ""hibachi"" are what the Japanese would call ""shichirin"":



I'm guessing that the term ""hibachi"" was popularized in North America because ""shichirin"" can be hard to pronounce for Anglophones.

Somewhere along the way, primarily in North America, the term ""hibachi"" also started to be used to refer to teppanyaki:



I'm not sure when or why this started; perhaps it has something to do with the fact that Banihana confusingly refers to their teppanyaki restaurants as ""hibachi-style"".

Among these, teppanyaki is most similar to Mongolian barbecue, in which meat is cooked on large, round, cast iron griddles:



(Images taken from Wikipedia.)

If you were to actually go to a Japanese restaurant and cook your own food over a shichirin, it would likely be referred to as ""yakiniku"", which is believed to have some origins in Korean barbecue.

Whereas teppanyaki has been a traditional Japanese cooking method for a long time, ""Mongolian barbecue"" was developed in the 1970s in Taipei, Taiwan.  During that time, Japanese Teppanyaki was very popular in Taiwan, so many people speculate that was actually the inspiration for Mongolian barbecue.  There are also some similarities between the Japanese dish ""jingisukan"" and Mongolian barbecue, however, jingisukan predates Mongolian barbecue.

682,682,1077,"Shortening the coax on UHF CB antenna caused SWR to get worse, why?","I shortened the coax cable on my car's 477MHz CB antenna because the braid was frayed at the transciever connector end, and a metre or so of spare coax was coiled up behind the dash. I thought if I cut the coax shorter, I would remove a little cable loss.

I measured SWR with a meter before and after: Before was 1.3:1, after 1.7:1. This seems quite a bit worse. I don't know how much this will affect performance.

I think I assembled the new connector pretty well, good solder joints to centre and braid.

Could my antenna setup be sensitive to the length of the coax? I have not heard of tuned lengths but my understanding of antenna and feeds is limited.

My vehicle's antenna is mounted at the front, it has a short solid base tube with a standard threaded mount onto which I fitted a 60cm 4.5dBi whip (the original antenna was missing). I don't know exactly what the antenna mount is but it looks similar to this one.

I'd like to understand what has happened, if I have significantly affected the performance of my antenna system, and how I might be able to fix it if so (splice the cut part of the coax back on?)
",blueshift,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/5949,"As long the antenna and the xmitter have the same impedance and they are connected with coax with same characterics impedance, then the length of coax has minimal impact on SWR.
You did measure the SWR before, now this means that from point you have measured it was a factor 1.3, this could mean that antenna was not tunned good and the cable itself was radiating acting like antenna, in sum the SWR was 1.3.

Why?,"I shortened the coax cable on my car's 477MHz CB antenna because the braid was frayed at the transciever connector end, and a metre or so of spare coax was coiled up behind the dash. I thought if I cut the coax shorter, I would remove a little cable loss.

I measured SWR with a meter before and after: Before was 1.3:1, after 1.7:1. This seems quite a bit worse. I don't know how much this will affect performance.

I think I assembled the new connector pretty well, good solder joints to centre and braid.

Could my antenna setup be sensitive to the length of the coax? I have not heard of tuned lengths but my understanding of antenna and feeds is limited.

My vehicle's antenna is mounted at the front, it has a short solid base tube with a standard threaded mount onto which I fitted a 60cm 4.5dBi whip (the original antenna was missing). I don't know exactly what the antenna mount is but it looks similar to this one.

I'd like to understand what has happened, if I have significantly affected the performance of my antenna system, and how I might be able to fix it if so (splice the cut part of the coax back on?)
","As long the antenna and the xmitter have the same impedance and they are connected with coax with same characterics impedance, then the length of coax has minimal impact on SWR.
You did measure the SWR before, now this means that from point you have measured it was a factor 1.3, this could mean that antenna was not tunned good and the cable itself was radiating acting like antenna, in sum the SWR was 1.3. Now you have cut of some piece of cable, normaly now it should perform better as the loss is smaller, but the whole impedance has now changed as the xmitter see. Therefore the antenna was never tuned properly, tune it.

How can I figure out the directory for X app on the device? On iOS 8, achieving this seems harder due to the way the app filesystem is structured.
",Theo5,https://stackoverflow.com/users/4318377,"iOS 7 and below

AppStore apps are installed in /var/mobile/Applications inside directory with random name. App's directories (documents, library etc) and *.app directory are both inside it. To determine which app it is you need to parse Info.plist file inside *.app directory where app name and bundle identifier are stored.

iOS 8

Apple completely changed the way AppStore apps are stored in filesystem. Everything we need now is in /var/mobile/Containers directory - at this point every directory I mention further down the text is contained inside that directory. All bundles (anything that contains application code) are stored in Bundle directory. There you will find apps, plugins and may be some other stuff. 

For example, OpenVPN application contains two bundles with application code - OpenVPN.app with application executable and OpenVPNPlugin.vpnplugin which implements OpenVPN protocol as iOS VPN plugin. OpenVPN.app is in Applications directory and OpenVPNPlugin.vpnplugin is in VPNPlugin. For some reason OpenVPNPlugin.vpnplugin is also stored in Applications but it looks like it's a temporary measure for compatibility reasons.

All application data now stored in Data directory. Applications, plugins store their data inside that directory.

Apps directories (documents, library etc) now stored in Data/Application inside directory with random name. To determine which app directories it is you need to parse Data/Application/xx-xx-xx/.com.apple.mobile_container_manager.metadata.plist. Inside it you will find MCMMetadataIdentifier key that contains app's bundle identifier.

There are also Data/PluginKitPlugin and Data/VPNPlugin directories on my device. Again, parse Data/PluginKitPlugin/xx-xx-xx/.com.apple.mobile_container_manager.metadata.plist and Data/VPNPlugin/xx-xx-xx/.com.apple.mobile_container_manager.metadata.plist respectively. Inside it you will find MCMMetadataIdentifier key that contains plugin's bundle identifier. In case of PluginKitPlugin, to determine to which app it belongs you need to go to *.app. It seems PluginKitPlugin bundles are stored in *.app/PlugIns. Parse it's Info.plist to determine plugin's bundle identifier. As an example you can look at how Evernote is stored.

And finally there is Shared directory. It seems it contains app's documents that can be shared between different apps. Again, inside Shared you will find directory with random name. To determine which app shared that documents parse the .com.apple.mobile_container_manager.metadata.plist. MCMMetadataIdentifier will contain group. string concatenated with app's bundle identifier.

iOS 8 Update

Since iOS 8.4 Apple once again changed things. Now there are no .com.apple.mobile_container_manager.metadata.plist files. Instead you need to parse /var/mobile/Library/MobileInstallation/LastLaunchServicesMap.plist. It holds information about all installed applications (even system ones) since iOS 8 so you actually don't need .com.apple.mobile_container_manager.metadata.plist at all. 

The plist has a very simple structure. First is dictionary with two main keys


System - dictionary of system applications (including Cydia ones)
User - dictionary of user applications (AppStore, enterprise, developer apps etc)


Those dictionaries use bundle identifier as key and dictionary with application info as value. For example:


Path - path to application bundle directory
Container - path to application directories (documents, library etc)

Secondly, what do you mean by ""filtration""? Are you just talking carbon filtration to remove a little sediment, large-scale microbial filtration, osmotic water purification? There is a wide range of levels of filtration depending on how small the objects are that you want to remove. Anything less than an osmotic purifier is pretty much useless because they will pass through all dissolved solids and most pathogens (like e. coli etc). If you just want to get rid of some rust/dirt, then carbon is correct, but if you want to purify the water to any degree you will need osmosis.

Thirdly any filter reduces the water flow a LOT and takes pressure down to about zero. So that means that if you want to, say, take a shower, you will have to repressurize the water after you filter it. So, the filter puts the water in a large tank, then you have to have a high-power pump that will repressurize the water coming out of that tank.

4539,4539,7192,Analytical solution to PDE,"I am trying to solve the following linear pde where $u=f(x,y)$ in the domain $y \in  (0,\infty)$: 
$$y\dfrac{\partial{u}}{\partial x} = \dfrac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}$$
with boundary conditions: 
$$u(x,0)=\sin(x) $$ 
$$\lim_{y \rightarrow \infty} u(x,y) = 0 .$$

Can someone please suggest how do I proceed to get the analytical solution for this equation? 



Solution: 

Using method of separation of variables, 
we assume solution to be of the form: $$u(x,y)=X(x).Y(y) $$
Inserting this to the pde, we get: 
$$yX'Y=XY'' $$
$$\dfrac{X'}{X}=\dfrac{Y''}{yY}=-\lambda$$
Now we get the following ode's 
$$X'+\lambda X=0 $$
$$Y'' + \lambda y Y = 0 $$

from which we get two general solutions of the following form: 
$$X(x) = c_1\exp(-\lambda x) \qquad Y(y) = c_2Ai(\lambda^{1/3} y) + c_3Bi(\lambda^{1/3} y)  $$ where $Ai$ and $Bi $ are Airy's functions and the general solution can be expressed as: 
$$u(x,y) =  c_1\exp(-\lambda x).(c_2Ai(\lambda^{1/3} y) + c_3Bi(\lambda^{1/3} y))$$

$c_3 \rightarrow 0 $ to satisfy second boundary condition since $Bi(\infty) \rightarrow \infty $ and hence, solution is of the form: 

$$u(x,y) = A \exp(-\lambda x) Ai(\lambda^{1/3} y) $$
Putting $y=0$,

$$y\dfrac{\partial{u}}{\partial x} = \dfrac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}$$
with boundary conditions: 
$$u(x,0)=\sin(x) $$ 
$$\lim_{y \rightarrow \infty} u(x,y) = 0 .$$

Can someone please suggest how do I proceed to get the analytical solution for this equation? 



Solution: 

Using method of separation of variables, 
we assume solution to be of the form: $$u(x,y)=X(x).Y(y) $$
Inserting this to the pde, we get: 
$$yX'Y=XY'' $$
$$\dfrac{X'}{X}=\dfrac{Y''}{yY}=-\lambda$$
Now we get the following ode's 
$$X'+\lambda X=0 $$
$$Y'' + \lambda y Y = 0 $$

from which we get two general solutions of the following form: 
$$X(x) = c_1\exp(-\lambda x) \qquad Y(y) = c_2Ai(\lambda^{1/3} y) + c_3Bi(\lambda^{1/3} y)  $$ where $Ai$ and $Bi $ are Airy's functions and the general solution can be expressed as: 
$$u(x,y) =  c_1\exp(-\lambda x).(c_2Ai(\lambda^{1/3} y) + c_3Bi(\lambda^{1/3} y))$$

$c_3 \rightarrow 0 $ to satisfy second boundary condition since $Bi(\infty) \rightarrow \infty $ and hence, solution is of the form: 

$$u(x,y) = A \exp(-\lambda x) Ai(\lambda^{1/3} y) $$
Putting $y=0$, 
$$u(x,0) = A\exp(-\lambda x).\dfrac{1}{3^{2/3}}\Gamma({2/3}) = \sin(x) $$

How should I now proceed to find $A$ and $\lambda$, considering that $\lambda$ needs to be positive real value?

",jj2,https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/11533,"The Hebrew used in the Tanakh is often the source for most of Modern Hebrew. However, influences of history have changed the modern day Hebrew in ways that are not always so noticeable. For Example:

A lot of Aramaic has slipped its way into modern Hebrew, even down to the most basic words.

Father in Tanakh: ""Av""
Father in Modern Hebrew: ""Abba"" (Aramaic)

This is not a unique phenomenon, the Tanakh itself has loan words from other languages. If you asked the average Israeli, they would not know that Abba is Aramaic in origin.

The reversing waw/vav is also heavily prevalent in Biblical Hebrew (but by no means is used 100% of the time). It's common English name of the reversing waw/vav is because it switches the past tense to future tense, and future tense to past tense, simply by adding a waw to the front of the verb. You often see a mixing of the normal verb conjugation with a sprinkling of this reversing waw in many paragraphs, including the first paragraph of the Torah.

Some other oddities would include the verb roots having changed as Hebrew pronunciation by communities caused mistakes to become the new norm. i can't remember the word off the top of my head, but i remember that the root in the Tanakh had an Ayin, but in modern Hebrew, the Ayin was replaced with an Aleph, most likely due to the pronunciation of Ayin being lost in many communities and the writing reflecting the pronunciation.

Another possible large difference is the use of the ""present tense."" Modern Hebrew has an established present tense, while according to Historians and Biblical grammarians, Biblical Hebrew has no ""present tense."" According to them, Biblical Hebrew has only two tenses, perfect tense (action is complete) and imperfect tense (action is not yet complete). For them, words/conjugations that we would call present tense are actually ""active participles."" An example of what this means/looks like would be the following:


  אָנִי שׁוֹמֵר אוֹתֶךָ
  
  How the text translates in Modern Hebrew: ""I am guarding you."" 
  
  How the text translates in Biblical Hebrew according to Historians: ""I am the
  one that guards you.""


But if you try and make the argument of Biblical Hebrew not having a present tense to your local Rabbi, be prepared for some resistance. The prior two times i had mentioned in a Synagogue setting that Biblical Hebrew did not have a present tense, it led to a very long debate in which the Rabbi's would refuse to allow anyone who heard my statement to walk away with the belief that Biblical Hebrew didn't have a present tense.

As far as I know, this is the text that any English Hebrew dictionary can use to translate for an English speaker, but how can this be confirmed? Is there any official Rabbi consistency in Hebrew?","The Hebrew used in the Tanakh is often the source for most of Modern Hebrew. However, influences of history have changed the modern day Hebrew in ways that are not always so noticeable. For Example:

A lot of Aramaic has slipped its way into modern Hebrew, even down to the most basic words.

Father in Tanakh: ""Av""
Father in Modern Hebrew: ""Abba"" (Aramaic)

This is not a unique phenomenon, the Tanakh itself has loan words from other languages. If you asked the average Israeli, they would not know that Abba is Aramaic in origin.

The reversing waw/vav is also heavily prevalent in Biblical Hebrew (but by no means is used 100% of the time). It's common English name of the reversing waw/vav is because it switches the past tense to future tense, and future tense to past tense, simply by adding a waw to the front of the verb. You often see a mixing of the normal verb conjugation with a sprinkling of this reversing waw in many paragraphs, including the first paragraph of the Torah.

On the other hand, although most of what's in the immediate vicinity of the explosion would be vaporised to atoms (or parts thereof), it seems possible that you could end up with significant amounts of debris. Perhaps the solar wind would blow the smaller ones away, much like the effect with a comet, but some of the larger chunks would present major navigational hazards.

The use of the webfont is properly specified in the CSS with correct URL pointing to a .woff file hosted in the server that runs the site.

I load a second page, the page doesn't load.

but I think you are missing a few key points here.

There are some conventions that you seem to be ignoring

ShoppingCart.cs should be named ShoppingCartController.cs and appear in the controllers folder of your project

Instead of naming each price on the model you can use a list of prices options and display them on the form as a series of radio buttons while putting the mutually exclusive choice. for example.

The Model

public class Product{

// remove all the different price properties. 

// other properties go here...And while you are at it Use Pascal case for property names Eg. displaySize would be DisplaySize but I guess that is up to you.

[Required]
public string PriceChoice { get; set; }

}

public ActionResult Details(int productId)
{
   // get the product from the database
    var model = Database.GetProductById(productId);

   // set a default if you want
   model.PriceChoice = ""a"";

6031,6031,9572,Does reach let you threaten an opponent if there is another opponent between you?,"Okay, the following situation came up in a recent game of Pathfinder. Pretend the following are in a straight line, in a standard 5' grid with their bases touching each other.

player's summoned creature with 10' reach -> enemy minion-> enemy boss -> player

The only creature with extra reach in this scenario is the summoned creature. Does it threaten the enemy boss (who is 10' away) and provide flanking for the player?

The rules state ""You threaten all squares into which you can make a melee attack"", which led my group to think it did indeed threaten the enemy boss. However, we're unclear on if the enemy minion between the boss and summoned creature provides cover, and if so, how that might impact threatened squares.
",Sterno,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/213,"You would flank, but cannot make Attacks of Opportunity*

Threatening


  Threatened Squares: You threaten all squares into which you can make a
  melee attack, even when it is not your turn. Generally, that means
  everything in all squares adjacent to your space (including
  diagonally). An enemy that takes certain actions while in a threatened
  square provokes an attack of opportunity from you. If you're unarmed,
  you don't normally threaten any squares and thus can't make attacks of
  opportunity.


AoO Rule:


  Cover and Attacks of Opportunity: You can't execute an attack of
  opportunity against an opponent with cover relative to you.


Soft Cover Rule:


  Soft Cover: Creatures, even your enemies, can provide you with cover
  against ranged attacks, giving you a +4 bonus to AC. However, such
  soft cover provides no bonus on Reflex saves, nor does soft cover
  allow you to make a Stealth check.


Those both come from the PRD section on Combat

As @Jim Kiley notes, there is no rule that states cover negates threatening. Just that it negates taking AoOs.

So, yes, the creature would provide a flanking bonus, but would be unable to make attacks of opportunity.

*This is muddied a bit by the fact that ""Threatened Squares"" are only described under attacks of opportunity, and it is a bit unclear if ""threaten"" == ""can make an AoO"". RAW, they're not technically the same thing, and thus my interpretation.

Edit: Turns out Creatures are only cover against ranged attacks, (double edit) but you determine cover as if with range if the target is not adjacent.


  When making a melee attack against a target that isn't adjacent to you
  (such as with a reach weapon), use the rules for determining cover
  from ranged attacks.


BUT

If the creature is large or larger, it gets to do this (which means if it's hampered by a medium creature it could probably finagle itself outside of cover):


  Big Creatures and Cover: Any creature with a space larger than 5 feet
  (1 square) determines cover against melee attacks slightly differently
  than smaller creatures do. Such a creature can choose any square that
  it occupies to determine if an opponent has cover against its melee
  attacks. Similarly, when making a melee attack against such a
  creature, you can pick any of the squares it occupies to determine if
  it has cover against you.

6058,6058,9614,Possessive form (of) with compound nouns,"
  This is a main difference between the personality of good people and bad
  people.


Is the sentence comparing personality of good people and personality of bad people? or comparing personality of good people and bad people?

How to avoid ambiguity when using of with compound nouns?
",zx_wing,https://english.stackexchange.com/users/88615,"As I understand it, your question about the sentence


  This is a main difference between the personality of good people and bad people.


involves determining whether ""the personality of good people"" is being contrasted with ""bad people"" or with ""[the personality of] bad people."" Structurally the sentence permits (with a little logical fudging) either reading, though I suspect that the author intends the second one.

That being the case, the biggest weakness of the sentence as written is that it seems to favor a logical reading that finds the intended contrast to be between ""the personality of good people"" (where ""personality"" is obviously a singular noun) on the one hand and ""bad people"" on the other. We can start to overcome that problem by changing personality to personalities:


  This is a main difference between the personalities of good people and bad people.


At this point, we still have (from a strictly logical reading of the sentence) a contrast between ""the personalities of good people"" on the one hand and ""bad people"" on the other. But beyond that, we have a plausible set of parallels attaching to the stem word of: ""good people"" and ""bad people."" And whereas before that of linked problematically to a singular personality, it now links to the plural personalities—a better platform for the parallelism. And we can strengthen the parallelism of these phrases by adding the word  of before ""bad people"":


  This is a main difference between the personalities of good people and of bad people.


Now the parallel phrases ""of good people"" and ""of bad people"" attach to the stem word personalities—and a reader cannot logically misread the intended contrast as being between ""the personalities of good people"" on the one hand and ""bad people"" on the other, without ignoring the of immediately preceding ""bad people.""

As other answerers and commenters have pointed out, there are alternative ways to make the sentence unambiguously present a contrast between the two types of personalities. For example, you could say


  This is a main difference between the personality of good people and the personality of bad people. 


But the shorter form that I suggest is every bit as clearly parallel and yet (to my mind) somewhat less tedious.

Conversely, if you wanted to establish a contrast between ""bad people"" on the one hand and ""the personality of good people"" on the other, the simplest way to proceed would be to flip their order in your original sentence:


  This is a main difference between bad people and the personality of good people. 


Either way the things that the sentence is seeking to compare are clearly defined, and readers won't be tempted to misread the writer's meaning.



As a side note, I acknowledge that the form ""the personalities of good people and of bad people"" may suggest to some readers that the author is comparing multiple personalities of good people to multiple personalities of bad people, whereas the original wording seems to take the view that good people have one unitary personality and people a very different unitary personality. If this change runs afoul of the author's intentions, we could revise the wording (again) to say something like this:

  people.


Is the sentence comparing personality of good people and personality of bad people? or comparing personality of good people and bad people?

How to avoid ambiguity when using of with compound nouns?
","As I understand it, your question about the sentence


  This is a main difference between the personality of good people and bad people.


involves determining whether ""the personality of good people"" is being contrasted with ""bad people"" or with ""[the personality of] bad people."" Structurally the sentence permits (with a little logical fudging) either reading, though I suspect that the author intends the second one.

That being the case, the biggest weakness of the sentence as written is that it seems to favor a logical reading that finds the intended contrast to be between ""the personality of good people"" (where ""personality"" is obviously a singular noun) on the one hand and ""bad people"" on the other. We can start to overcome that problem by changing personality to personalities:


  This is a main difference between the personalities of good people and bad people.


At this point, we still have (from a strictly logical reading of the sentence) a contrast between ""the personalities of good people"" on the one hand and ""bad people"" on the other. But beyond that, we have a plausible set of parallels attaching to the stem word of: ""good people"" and ""bad people."" And whereas before that of linked problematically to a singular personality, it now links to the plural personalities—a better platform for the parallelism. And we can strengthen the parallelism of these phrases by adding the word  of before ""bad people"":


  This is a main difference between the personalities of good people and of bad people.


Now the parallel phrases ""of good people"" and ""of bad people"" attach to the stem word personalities—and a reader cannot logically misread the intended contrast as being between ""the personalities of good people"" on the one hand and ""bad people"" on the other, without ignoring the of immediately preceding ""bad people.""

As other answerers and commenters have pointed out, there are alternative ways to make the sentence unambiguously present a contrast between the two types of personalities. For example, you could say


  This is a main difference between the personality of good people and the personality of bad people. 


But the shorter form that I suggest is every bit as clearly parallel and yet (to my mind) somewhat less tedious.

Conversely, if you wanted to establish a contrast between ""bad people"" on the one hand and ""the personality of good people"" on the other, the simplest way to proceed would be to flip their order in your original sentence:


  This is a main difference between bad people and the personality of good people. 


Either way the things that the sentence is seeking to compare are clearly defined, and readers won't be tempted to misread the writer's meaning.



As a side note, I acknowledge that the form ""the personalities of good people and of bad people"" may suggest to some readers that the author is comparing multiple personalities of good people to multiple personalities of bad people, whereas the original wording seems to take the view that good people have one unitary personality and people a very different unitary personality. If this change runs afoul of the author's intentions, we could revise the wording (again) to say something like this:


  This is a main difference between the personality of good people and that of bad people.


where the new parallels are ""the personality of good people"" and ""that of bad people,"" both attached to the stem word between.

3514,3514,5604,Why do objects fall at the same acceleration?,"I read these two posts and now I am more confused.

Do heavier objects fall faster?

Don&#39;t heavier objects actually fall faster because they exert their own gravity?

I was going to ask: if mass is an objects tendency to resist acceleration then why do two objects of different masses fall to the Earth at the same acceleration?

Then I read those posts and it seems that even though it is very small, the more massive object falls faster. Okay I understand, both objects attract each other.

If two cars of different masses collide doesn't the car with less mass accelerate more even though both cars received the same Force. Then that implies you need more force to accelerate a large mass than to accelerate a small mass. Because that is how I see it, the Moon attracts the Earth with the same Force as the Earth attracts the Moon but the Earth accelerates less due to its larger mass.

So then how is mass an object's tendency to resist acceleration? I am aware of $F_1 = F_2 = GMm/r^2$. So should we not really be able to see the difference in acceleration when dropping a massive object?

4718,4718,7484,Retirement Funds: Betterment vs Vanguard Life strategy vs Target Retirement,"I'm a 20 something grad student and would like to open a hands off retirement account with beta exposure to the market and would make monthly contributions. I'm fairly illiterate when it comes to investing, and the betterment account seems so user friendly. However, I realize it is a more expensive fund. Being that I can do math, I realize these fees add up over time. However, I like that betterment re-balances it self and I really like that it allows one to easily change the allocation of stocks and bonds. I know I said I wanted a hands off account, but what if the stock market crashes and I want to allocate more to bonds??? Does Vanguard re-balance and allow you to reallocate?

So far, I'm am leaning towards Vanguard? Does Betterment have advantages? Which Vanguard fund is more appropriate for a hands off investment account for retirement?  Both Vanguard accounts (Life strategy vs Target retirement) seem to have very similar fees and returns over the last 5 years. 
Thank you in advance.
",SoilSciGuy,https://money.stackexchange.com/users/9974,"First, congratulations on choosing to invest in low cost passively managed plans. If you choose any one of these options and stick with it, you will already be well ahead of most individual investors.

Almost all plans will allow you to re-balance between asset classes. With some companies, sales agents will encourage you to sell your overweighted assets and buy underweighted assets as this generates brokerage commissions for them, but when you only need to make minor adjustments, you can simply change the allocation of the new money going into your account until you are back to your target weights. Most plans will let you do this for free, and in general, you will only need to do this every few years at most.

I don't see much reason for you to be in the Target funds. The main feature of these plans is that they gradually shift you to a more conservative asset allocation over time, and are designed to prevent people who are close to retirement from being too aggressive and risking a major loss just before retirement. It's very likely that at your age, most plans will have very similar recommendations for your allocation, with equities at 80% or more, and this is unlikely to change for the next few decades.

The main benefits of betterment seems to be simplicity and ease of use, but there is one concern I would have for you with betterment. Precisely because it is so easy to tweak your allocation, I'm concerned that you might hurt your long-term results by reacting to short-term market conditions:


  I know I said I wanted a hands off account, but what if the stock market crashes and I want to allocate more to bonds???


One of the biggest reasons that stock returns are better than bond returns on average is that you are being paid to accept additional risk, and living with significant ups and downs is part of what it means to be in the stock market. If you are tempted to take money out of an asset class when it has been ""losing/feels dangerous"" and put more in when it is ""winning/feels safe"", my concerns is that you will end up buying high and selling low.

I'd recommend taking a look at this article on the emotional cycle of investing. My point is simply that it's very likely that if you are moving money in and out of stocks based on volatility, you're much less likely to get the full market return over the long term, and might be better off putting more weight in asset classes with lower volatility.

Either way, I'd recommend taking one or more risk tolerance assessments online and making sure you're committed to sticking with a long-term plan that doesn't involve more risk than you can really live with.

I tend to lean toward Vanguard Life Strategy simply because Vanguard as a company has been around longer, but betterment does seem very accessible to a new investor.

The content is very useful if its’ made the right way (as here on ux.se), but there are plenty of examples where it isn’t. The real question concerns the label which is a convention I’d like to challenge.

History

In 1647 Matthew Hopkins wrote The Discovery of Witches which were introduced as ""Certain Queries answered"" and had the form of a list of Question and Answer, even if the topic is inappropriate by today’s standards. The label FAQ origins from the early 1980s mailing lists where NASA hoped to get new users read the old mail conversations, which were not the case. Instead the same questions were answered again and again and the need for FAQ was born. The acronym FAQ was invented by Eugene Miya and FAQ were later used in mail on a weekly basis at first and later on as a daily mail.


  Today FAQ is more frequently used to refer to the list, and a text consisting of questions and their answers is often called an FAQ regardless of whether the questions are actually frequently asked, if they are asked at all.[1]


Problem

Acronyms are generally bad, since it excludes those who do not know the meaning. They either have to search for the acronym, if they are interested, or just ignore it. If a label is ignored, there is not much use of it and an entire section of valid content is lost by bad labeling. However, it is a very strong web convention which might lead to confusion over time for experienced users.
Also the original meaning have changed (see quote), which also implies that the label would be wrong.

is this a good approach to have persistent cookie sessions?
do I need to add to my local.settings.php session_regenerate_id() too?

is this a good approach to have persistent cookie sessions?
do I need to add to my local.settings.php session_regenerate_id() too?

Copyright does prohibit reproducing graphs or figures (again with some exceptions, such as fair use in the U.S.).  However, it's OK to create a different graph/figure that conveys the same information.

",gasko peter,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/9616,"Very few viruses will infect the network card on your server.  Viruses typically infect your OS or other application software.  Therefore, for most purposes you don't need to worry about viruses in your network card.

3889,3889,6195,PostgreSQL bytea vs smallint[],"I'm looking to import large (100Mb -- 1 GB) multi-channel time-series data into a PostgreSQL database. The data comes from EDF format files that chunks the data into ""records"" or ""epochs"" of typically a few seconds each. Each epoch's record holds the signals for each channel of data as sequential arrays of short integers.

I'm mandated to store the files within the database, in the worst case as BLOBs. Given that, I'd like to investigate options that would allow me to do something more with the data within the database, such as facilitating queries based upon the signal data.

My initial plan is to store the data as one row per epoch record. What I'm trying to weigh up is whether to store the actual signal data as bytea or smallint[] (or even smallint[][]) types. Could anyone recommend one over the other? I'm interested in storage and access costs. Usage is likely to be insert once, read occasionally, update never. If one were more easily wrapped up as a custom type such that I could add functions for analysing of comparing records then so much the better.

No doubt I'm low on detail, so feel free to add comments on what you'd like me to clarify.
",beldaz,https://dba.stackexchange.com/users/13111,"In the absence of any answers I've explored the issue further myself.

It looks like user-defined functions can handle all base types, including bytea and smallint[], so this doesn't affect the choice of representation much.

I tried out several different representations on a PostgreSQL 9.4 server running locally on a Windows 7 laptop with a vanilla configuration. The relations to store that actual signal data were as follows.

Large Object for entire file

CREATE TABLE BlobFile (
    eeg_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    eeg_oid OID NOT NULL
);


SMALLINT array per channel

CREATE TABLE EpochChannelArray (
    eeg_id INT NOT NULL,
    epoch INT NOT NULL,
    channel INT,
    signal SMALLINT[] NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (eeg_id, epoch, channel)
);


BYTEA per channel in each epoch

CREATE TABLE EpochChannelBytea (
    eeg_id INT NOT NULL,
    epoch INT NOT NULL,
    channel INT,
    signal BYTEA NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (eeg_id, epoch, channel)
);


SMALLINT 2D array per epoch

CREATE TABLE EpochArray (
    eeg_id INT NOT NULL,
    epoch INT NOT NULL,
    signals SMALLINT[][] NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (eeg_id, epoch)
);


BYTEA array per epoch

CREATE TABLE EpochBytea (
    eeg_id INT NOT NULL,
    epoch INT NOT NULL,
    signals BYTEA NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (eeg_id, epoch)
);


I then imported a selection of EDF files into each of these relations via Java JDBC and compared the growth in database size after each upload. 

The files were:


File A: 2706 epochs of 16 channels, each channel 1024 samples (16385
samples per epoch), 85 MB
File B: 11897 epochs of 18 channels, each channel 1024 samples (18432 samples per epoch), 418 MB
File C: 11746 epochs of 20 channels, each channel 64 to 1024 samples (17088 samples per epoch), 382 MB


In terms of storage cost, here's the size occupied in MB for each case:


Relative to the original file size, Large Objects were about 30-35% larger. By contrast, storing each epoch as either a BYTEA or SMALLINT[][] was less than 10% larger. Storing each channel as a separate tuple give a 40% increase, as either BYTEA or SMALLINT[], so not much worse than storing as a large object.

One thing I hadn't initially appreciated is that ""Multidimensional arrays must have matching extents for each dimension"" in PostgreSQL. This means that the SMALLINT[][] representation only works when all channels in an epoch have the same number of samples. Hence File C fails to work with the EpochArray relation.

In terms as access costs, I haven't played around with this, but at least in terms of inserting the data initially the fastest representation was EpochBytea and BlobFile, with EpochChannelArray the slowest, taking about 3 times as long as the first two.

The data comes from EDF format files that chunks the data into ""records"" or ""epochs"" of typically a few seconds each. Each epoch's record holds the signals for each channel of data as sequential arrays of short integers.

I'm mandated to store the files within the database, in the worst case as BLOBs. Given that, I'd like to investigate options that would allow me to do something more with the data within the database, such as facilitating queries based upon the signal data.

My initial plan is to store the data as one row per epoch record. What I'm trying to weigh up is whether to store the actual signal data as bytea or smallint[] (or even smallint[][]) types. Could anyone recommend one over the other? I'm interested in storage and access costs. Usage is likely to be insert once, read occasionally, update never. If one were more easily wrapped up as a custom type such that I could add functions for analysing of comparing records then so much the better.

No doubt I'm low on detail, so feel free to add comments on what you'd like me to clarify.
","In the absence of any answers I've explored the issue further myself.

It looks like user-defined functions can handle all base types, including bytea and smallint[], so this doesn't affect the choice of representation much.

I tried out several different representations on a PostgreSQL 9.4 server running locally on a Windows 7 laptop with a vanilla configuration. The relations to store that actual signal data were as follows.

Large Object for entire file

CREATE TABLE BlobFile (
    eeg_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    eeg_oid OID NOT NULL
);


SMALLINT array per channel

CREATE TABLE EpochChannelArray (
    eeg_id INT NOT NULL,
    epoch INT NOT NULL,
    channel INT,
    signal SMALLINT[] NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (eeg_id, epoch, channel)
);


BYTEA per channel in each epoch

CREATE TABLE EpochChannelBytea (
    eeg_id INT NOT NULL,
    epoch INT NOT NULL,
    channel INT,
    signal BYTEA NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (eeg_id, epoch, channel)
);


SMALLINT 2D array per epoch

CREATE TABLE EpochArray (
    eeg_id INT NOT NULL,
    epoch INT NOT NULL,
    signals SMALLINT[][] NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (eeg_id, epoch)
);


BYTEA array per epoch

CREATE TABLE EpochBytea (
    eeg_id INT NOT NULL,
    epoch INT NOT NULL,
    signals BYTEA NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (eeg_id, epoch)
);


I then imported a selection of EDF files into each of these relations via Java JDBC and compared the growth in database size after each upload. 

The files were:


File A: 2706 epochs of 16 channels, each channel 1024 samples (16385
samples per epoch), 85 MB
File B: 11897 epochs of 18 channels, each channel 1024 samples (18432 samples per epoch), 418 MB
File C: 11746 epochs of 20 channels, each channel 64 to 1024 samples (17088 samples per epoch), 382 MB


In terms of storage cost, here's the size occupied in MB for each case:


Relative to the original file size, Large Objects were about 30-35% larger. By contrast, storing each epoch as either a BYTEA or SMALLINT[][] was less than 10% larger.

This array is supposed to be kept separate from the 'active' array, so that the active array can be reset on a button press.

I use self.editContents = [self.cleanEditContents copy]; to set the active array both directly after the clean array is populated and on a button press.

There is a problem where even though I reset the array and call reloadData and setNeedsLayout (overkill? probably), the numbers don't reset. I tried outputting the values of the same position in both arrays and it turns out that any changes made to the active array contaminate the clean array.
","copy does a shallow copy. In other words, self.editContents and self.cleanEditContents both reference the same set of mutable arrays. So if you update a mutable array in one, the change is seen in the other.

To create self.editContents, create a new array with mutable copies of the inner arrays.

NSMutableArray *tmp = [NSMutableArray array];
for (NSArray *array in self.cleanEditContents) {
    [tmp addObject:[array mutableCopy]];
}
self.editContents = tmp;

357,357,566,Are some tires safer than others?,"I bought a Bell Road tire from Walmart. Since I haven't exactly had great luck with Walmart bicycle products, I looked up the reviews... not so great.

In their defense, they are 1.375, not 1.25, but still, the things couldn't stay on my bike... in a sharp, low-speed turn with minimal leaning from me, the bead just popped off!

Then there is the Continental Gatorskin tire with a much better set of review on amazon.  But, does it matter?

I know I'm being a little specific, but what I want to know is how do I minimize my chances of my tires trying to kill me?

I realize this may look like a shopping question, but I have to purchase tires that I use!

I'd appreciate any advice from guys who actually have enough experience to really comment on tires.
",user1833028,https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/users/7136,"It sounds as though your problem was a somewhat loose tyre not properly seated. It may have been loose enough that it couldn't be properly seated, but in that case I'd expect it to pop off and the tube explode while you were pumping it up for the first time. You may also be running the tyres at too low a pressure, with a skinny tyre like that I'd expect them to need 70psi or more.

So, seating a new tyre: 


fit the uninflated tyre and tube as you normally do
pump it up to 10-15psi - just enough that there's air in there but it's still very spongy
ideally spin the wheel, but just looking around it also works. Look for bulges or dips in the tyre sidewall relative to the rim, ideally using a line around the tyre (a moulding line or the reflective strip).
when you see a dip down into the rim, grab the tyre firmly on both sides and rock your hand to pull that bulge up into the correct position.
when you see a bulge upward you need to pull the rest of the tyre down. Start 1 few inches past the bulge and rock the tyre up (as above), then repeat this around the tyre until you're back at the bulge (which should be gone by now)
repeat on the other side of the tyre.


Steps 4 and 5 are easy to skip, and the reason why you want very little air in that tyre. The ""explode on first inflation"" thing happens occasionally in bike shops, and it's a chance for everyone else to laugh at whoever did it. After getting over the shock of the loud noise!

Normally this is just a quick eyeball check of both sides of the tyre, and I'll often skip it with tyres that are tight on the rim. If it's hard to get on, it'll usually seat firmly as soon as air goes in. But loose tyres I'm very careful of (see ""loud noise"" above).



(edit to add)

Picking Tyres

My impression is that many (most?) cyclists I know go to a local bike shop and talk to people, see what's available, and buy something they can actually touch. At least once, anyway, before going ""I can get these much cheaper online"". Having decided on a brand or brands, and a preference for fat/slick/kevlar-studded and so on, they then grind through a few options over the next few thousand kilometres of riding before developing either very strong preferences (like the bike geeks here), or a complete lack of interest. Working in a bike shop I really did get people who brought bikes in and said ""tyre. flat. replace. bye"" then walked out, leaving me holding a bike going ""can I at least get your phone number?""

Availability is also important. If you're going to try some tyres with a view to picking one you like, pick a manufacturer that's been around for a while and doesn't change their darn tyres every year. Otherwise every time you buy a tyre you have to work out which one best matches the one you bought last year. If you're buying online, try to pick a store that keeps stuff in stock. It's annoying buying something only to wait a month while it gets shipped from a warehouse in China when you chose a ""local"" online store.

Since I haven't exactly had great luck with Walmart bicycle products, I looked up the reviews... not so great.

In their defense, they are 1.375, not 1.25, but still, the things couldn't stay on my bike... in a sharp, low-speed turn with minimal leaning from me, the bead just popped off!

Then there is the Continental Gatorskin tire with a much better set of review on amazon.  But, does it matter?

I know I'm being a little specific, but what I want to know is how do I minimize my chances of my tires trying to kill me?

I realize this may look like a shopping question, but I have to purchase tires that I use!

I'd appreciate any advice from guys who actually have enough experience to really comment on tires.
","It sounds as though your problem was a somewhat loose tyre not properly seated. It may have been loose enough that it couldn't be properly seated, but in that case I'd expect it to pop off and the tube explode while you were pumping it up for the first time. You may also be running the tyres at too low a pressure, with a skinny tyre like that I'd expect them to need 70psi or more.

So, seating a new tyre: 


fit the uninflated tyre and tube as you normally do
pump it up to 10-15psi - just enough that there's air in there but it's still very spongy
ideally spin the wheel, but just looking around it also works. Look for bulges or dips in the tyre sidewall relative to the rim, ideally using a line around the tyre (a moulding line or the reflective strip).
when you see a dip down into the rim, grab the tyre firmly on both sides and rock your hand to pull that bulge up into the correct position.
when you see a bulge upward you need to pull the rest of the tyre down. Start 1 few inches past the bulge and rock the tyre up (as above), then repeat this around the tyre until you're back at the bulge (which should be gone by now)
repeat on the other side of the tyre.


Steps 4 and 5 are easy to skip, and the reason why you want very little air in that tyre. The ""explode on first inflation"" thing happens occasionally in bike shops, and it's a chance for everyone else to laugh at whoever did it. After getting over the shock of the loud noise!

Normally this is just a quick eyeball check of both sides of the tyre, and I'll often skip it with tyres that are tight on the rim. If it's hard to get on, it'll usually seat firmly as soon as air goes in. But loose tyres I'm very careful of (see ""loud noise"" above).



(edit to add)

Picking Tyres

My impression is that many (most?) cyclists I know go to a local bike shop and talk to people, see what's available, and buy something they can actually touch. At least once, anyway, before going ""I can get these much cheaper online"". Having decided on a brand or brands, and a preference for fat/slick/kevlar-studded and so on, they then grind through a few options over the next few thousand kilometres of riding before developing either very strong preferences (like the bike geeks here), or a complete lack of interest. Working in a bike shop I really did get people who brought bikes in and said ""tyre. flat. replace. bye"" then walked out, leaving me holding a bike going ""can I at least get your phone number?""

Availability is also important. If you're going to try some tyres with a view to picking one you like, pick a manufacturer that's been around for a while and doesn't change their darn tyres every year. Otherwise every time you buy a tyre you have to work out which one best matches the one you bought last year. If you're buying online, try to pick a store that keeps stuff in stock. It's annoying buying something only to wait a month while it gets shipped from a warehouse in China when you chose a ""local"" online store.

So, my preference is for puncture resistant to very, very puncture resistant slicks, with more puncture resistance on my commuter and less on my touring bike (where rolling resistance is more important). On my velomobile I went for extreme puncture resistance because going much faster also meant that the time taken to stop and fix a puncture stood out a lot more.

Do heavier objects fall faster?

Don&#39;t heavier objects actually fall faster because they exert their own gravity?

I was going to ask: if mass is an objects tendency to resist acceleration then why do two objects of different masses fall to the Earth at the same acceleration?

Then I read those posts and it seems that even though it is very small, the more massive object falls faster. Okay I understand, both objects attract each other.

If two cars of different masses collide doesn't the car with less mass accelerate more even though both cars received the same Force. Then that implies you need more force to accelerate a large mass than to accelerate a small mass. Because that is how I see it, the Moon attracts the Earth with the same Force as the Earth attracts the Moon but the Earth accelerates less due to its larger mass.

So then how is mass an object's tendency to resist acceleration? I am aware of $F_1 = F_2 = GMm/r^2$. So should we not really be able to see the difference in acceleration when dropping a massive object?

  I was going to ask: if mass is an objects tendency to resist acceleration then why do two objects of different masses fall to the Earth at the same acceleration?


Yes, you are right. If we want to push a feather we need less force and the feather resists the acceleration to less extent, and then if you want to push a iron ball we need more force and the iron ball resists the acceleration to more extent.   

So, it is correct that mass is the tendency of object to resist acceleration.   

Then, why do feather and iron ball gets accelerated to same extent towards the earth?
Isn't iron ball's mass greater than feather's mass, so iron ball should have greater tendency to resist acceleration than feather, thus iron ball should fall first than feather?    

Here, if we would had applied same force on iron ball and feather, iron ball would had greater tendency to resist acceleration than feather, so iron ball would get accelerated to less extent than feather. Here, although iron ball gets accelerated to less extent, its greater mass than feather makes force to be equal to force exerted on feather, where acceleration of feather is more but mass is less.  

But, earth doesn't exert same force on feather and iron ball. Force exerted on iron ball is greater than force exerted on feather. As it is confirmed from Pranav Hosangdi's answer that acceleration due to gravity is independent of mass of the body to which earth exerts force.  


  Then I read those posts and it seems that even though it is very small, the more massive object falls faster. Okay I understand, both objects attract each other.  


Seeing your comment, I  hope you have understood that because of air resistance iron ball falls first than feather.  


  If two cars of different masses collide doesn't the car with less mass accelerate more even though both cars received the same Force.   


Yes, the car with less mass accelerates to greater extent than the car with greater mass as  you stated force to be same on both.  


  Then that implies you need more force to accelerate a large mass than to accelerate a small mass. Because that is how I see it, the Moon attracts the Earth with the same Force as the Earth attracts the Moon but the Earth accelerates less due to its larger mass.


Yes, you need more force to accelerate a large mass than to accelerate a small mass. That is the reason earth exerts more force on massive objects than on tiny objects. You are also correct in saying about earth moon interaction.  


  So then how is mass an object's tendency to resist acceleration?  


So far there is nothing which has contradicted with how mass can't be tendency to resist acceleration. If there is any thing you can comment.  


  . So should we not really be able to see the difference in acceleration when dropping a massive object?  


Massive object and tiny objects are not exerted with the same force by the earth, you are thinking that on both the object force is same. Earth exerts different force on massive objects and tiny objects. Acceleration due to gravity has constant value at different points in space, just like electric field has constant value at different points in space. Acceleration due to gravity can be considered as gravitational field. So, no matter what mass you keep, it will be accelerated to same extent.

  I was going to ask: if mass is an objects tendency to resist acceleration then why do two objects of different masses fall to the Earth at the same acceleration?


Yes, you are right. If we want to push a feather we need less force and the feather resists the acceleration to less extent, and then if you want to push a iron ball we need more force and the iron ball resists the acceleration to more extent.   

So, it is correct that mass is the tendency of object to resist acceleration.   

Then, why do feather and iron ball gets accelerated to same extent towards the earth?
Isn't iron ball's mass greater than feather's mass, so iron ball should have greater tendency to resist acceleration than feather, thus iron ball should fall first than feather?    

Here, if we would had applied same force on iron ball and feather, iron ball would had greater tendency to resist acceleration than feather, so iron ball would get accelerated to less extent than feather. Here, although iron ball gets accelerated to less extent, its greater mass than feather makes force to be equal to force exerted on feather, where acceleration of feather is more but mass is less.  

But, earth doesn't exert same force on feather and iron ball. Force exerted on iron ball is greater than force exerted on feather. As it is confirmed from Pranav Hosangdi's answer that acceleration due to gravity is independent of mass of the body to which earth exerts force.  


  Then I read those posts and it seems that even though it is very small, the more massive object falls faster. Okay I understand, both objects attract each other.  


Seeing your comment, I  hope you have understood that because of air resistance iron ball falls first than feather.  


  If two cars of different masses collide doesn't the car with less mass accelerate more even though both cars received the same Force.   


Yes, the car with less mass accelerates to greater extent than the car with greater mass as  you stated force to be same on both.  


  Then that implies you need more force to accelerate a large mass than to accelerate a small mass. Because that is how I see it, the Moon attracts the Earth with the same Force as the Earth attracts the Moon but the Earth accelerates less due to its larger mass.


Yes, you need more force to accelerate a large mass than to accelerate a small mass. That is the reason earth exerts more force on massive objects than on tiny objects. You are also correct in saying about earth moon interaction.  


  So then how is mass an object's tendency to resist acceleration?  


So far there is nothing which has contradicted with how mass can't be tendency to resist acceleration. If there is any thing you can comment.  


  . So should we not really be able to see the difference in acceleration when dropping a massive object?  


Massive object and tiny objects are not exerted with the same force by the earth, you are thinking that on both the object force is same. Earth exerts different force on massive objects and tiny objects. Acceleration due to gravity has constant value at different points in space, just like electric field has constant value at different points in space. Acceleration due to gravity can be considered as gravitational field. So, no matter what mass you keep, it will be accelerated to same extent.

4199,4199,6697,Is it a problem with radiometric dating that carbon 14 is found in materials dated to millions of years old?,"The preferred method of dating dinosaur fossils is with the radiometric dating method. And the result of this accepted method dates dinosaur fossils to around 68 million years old.

However:
Consider the C-14 decay rate. Its half-life ($t_{1/2}$) is only 5,730 years—that is, every 5,730 years, half of it decays away. The theoretical limit for C-14 dating is 100,000 years using AMS, but for practical purposes it is 45,000 to 55,000 years. If dinosaur bones are 65 million years old, there should not be one atom of C-14 left in them.

Dinosaurs are not dated with Carbon-14, yet some researchers have claimed that there is still Carbon-14 in the bones.

So what needs to be done about this inconsistency? Do these data indicate that a more accurate method needs to be derived? What solutions are available for increasing accuracy of the tests? Or do we need another dating method all together?

Considering Contamination

From the source linked above:


  Carbon-14 is considered to be a highly reliable dating technique.  It's accuracy has been verified by using C-14 to date artifacts whose age is known historically. The fluctuation of the amount of C-14 in the atmosphere over time adds a small uncertainty, but contamination by ""modern carbon"" such as decayed organic matter from soils poses a greater possibility for error.
  
  Dr. Thomas Seiler, a physicist from Germany, gave the presentation in Singapore.  He said that his team and the laboratories they employed took special care to avoid contamination. That included protecting the samples, avoiding cracked areas in the bones, and meticulous pre-cleaning of the samples with chemicals to remove possible contaminants.  Knowing that small concentrations of collagen can attract contamination, they compared precision Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) tests of collagen and bioapatite (hard carbonate bone mineral) with conventional counting methods of large bone fragments from the same dinosaurs. ""Comparing such different molecules as minerals and organics from the same bone region, we obtained concordant C-14 results which were well below the upper limits of C-14 dating. These, together with many other remarkable concordances between samples from different fossils, geographic regions and stratigraphic positions make random contamination as origin of the C-14 unlikely"".

",Decrypted,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/52046,"There is a lot of discussion about this issue on this internet, so I think this question may be worth addressing seriously. The main point of the debate seems to be the following:

Over the past decades, several research groups of self-proclaimed creationist scientists have claimed discoveries of dinosaur bones that they have managed to date, using radiocarbon dating methods, at some age which is a lot below the 'usual' i.e. mainstream accepted date for the age of these bones (several dozens of million years old). The age that these groups claim to find is usually on the order of thousands or tens of thousands of years old.

The research by Miller et al.

The claims by these creationist research groups are quite spectacular; they deserve to be seriously looked into. Let us investigate the specific case referenced in the question: 
A research team from the CRSEF, or Creation Research, Science Education Foundation, led by Hugh Miller, has claimed to have dated dinosaur bones using radiocarbon methods, determining them to be no older than several dozens of thousands of years old. Let's look at their research methodology in detail (indicated by bullet points):


As it turns out, Miller's research group obtained their sample in quite a remarkable way. In fact, the creationist posed as chemists in order to secure a number of fragments of fossilized dinosaur bone from a museum of natural history, misrepresenting their own research in the process of doing so. 
When the museum provided the bone fragments, they emphasized that they had been heavily contaminated with ""shellac"" and other chemical preservatives. Miller and his group accepted the samples and reassured the museum that such containments would not be problematic for the analysis at hand. They then sent it to a laboratory run by the University of Arizona, where radiocarbon dating could be carried out. To get the scientists to consider their sample, the researchers once again pretended to be interested in the dating for general chemical analysis purposes, misrepresenting their research.


Let's quickly stop to consider the general issue of misrepresenting your own research. It is understandable that Miller et al. did this, since there would have been a slim chance (at best) of the museum curator providing them with any dinosaur bone fragments if he or she had known what the true intent of the supposed chemists was. In particular, it is implausible that it would have been considered worthwhile to try to use radiocarbon dating methods on these bones, since the rocks that they were taken from were determined to be 99+ million years old, as shown in this paper by Kowallis et al. Now, it is known that $^{14}\text{C}$ decays at a fast enough rate (half-life ~6000 years) for this dating method to be absolutely useless on such samples. Thus, it appears that Miller et al. would not have been able to obtain this sample, had they been honest about their intent. This, of course, raises some ethical questions, but let's brush these aside for now. We proceed with the examination of the research done by Miller and his fellow researchers from the CRSEF.

What exactly are we dating here? Sample contamination and general trustworthyness


After the samples were submitted by the laboratory, Miller et al. were informed by a professor from the University of Arizona that the samples were heavily contaminated, and that no collagen (where most of the carbon for $^{14}\text{C}$ dating comes from) was present. Miller let assured the professor that the analysis was still of interest to the group. The issue of contaminations is quite a serious one, as can be seen in this paper by Hedges and Gowlett (sorry, paywalled!!!). I quote (quote also reproduced in the paper by Lepper that I linked earlier: 



  At a horizon of 40,000 years the amount of carbon 14 in a
  bone or a piece of charcoal can be truly minute: such a
  specimen may contain only a few thousand 14C atoms. Consequently equally small quantities of modern carbon can
  severely skew the measurements. Contamination of this kind
  amounting to 1 percent of the carbon in a sample 25,000
  years old would make it appear to be about 1,500 years
  younger than its actual age. Such contamination would,
  however, reduce the apparent age of a 60,000-year-old object
  by almost 50 percent. Clearly proper sample decontamination
  procedures are of particular importance in
  the dating of very old artifacts 


It is clear that the sample provided by Miller did not under go any 'sample decontamination procedures' at all, and it is therefore strongly questionable to which extent it can be used to obtain a good estimate of the age of the bones. Furthermore, it appears less than certain that the carbon found in the bones actually had anything to do with them being dinosaur bones. In the article by Leppert, we find:


  Hugh Miller generously provided me with a copy of the
  elemental analysis of one of their dinosaur fossils. Daniel Fisher of the University
  of Michigan’s Museum of Paleontology examined these results and concludes that
  there is nothing whatsoever extraordinary about them. The predominant suite of
  elements present and their relative percentages (including the 3.4% carbon!) are
  about what one would expect to find in hydroxyapatite and calcite, two of the
  commonest minerals present in ordinary dinosaur fossils. There is absolutely
  nothing unusual about these fossils and no reason to think the carbon contained
  in them is organic carbon derived from the original dinosaur bone. 
  
  Robert Kalin senior research specialist at the University of Arizona’s
  radiocarbon dating laboratory, performed a standard independent analysis of the
  specimens submitted by Hugh Miller and concluded that the samples identified
  as “bones” did not contain any collagen. They were, in fact, not bone.


These results corroborated established paleontological theories that assert that these fossiles presumably were 'washed away' over long periods of time by ground water, replacing the original bones with other substances such as the minerals naturally present in the water, implying that this sample could not tell you anything about when a dinosaur lived (or rather, died). 

Conclusions

At this point, it is quite clear that there is little reason to trust the research by Miller's research group. In fact, the article by Leppert raises a number of additional issues (e.g. Miller's group refuses to reveal where some other samples of theirs were dated), but I think it is pointless to argue further: It is obvious that the CRSEF research group did a poor job in sticking to the scientific method, and that little objective value can be assigned to their supposed findings.

",Siddharth,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/14941,"The ""ripple"" effect you are showing is just a radial sinewave: sin(t), where t is the distance from some center.



Image from here

Doing this kind of deformation in a vertex or pixel shader is easy: just set up the center of the wave as a uniform variable waveCenter, then move every vertex in z (where z is the ""up"" direction) by MAGNITUDE*sin( FREQUENCY*t ), where t is the distance the vertex has from that waveCenter.  FREQUENCY is how fast you want the wave to ripple.  You can even make the wave fade out by dividing MAGNITUDE by the distance from the waveCenter.

","The ""ripple"" effect you are showing is just a radial sinewave: sin(t), where t is the distance from some center.



Image from here

Doing this kind of deformation in a vertex or pixel shader is easy: just set up the center of the wave as a uniform variable waveCenter, then move every vertex in z (where z is the ""up"" direction) by MAGNITUDE*sin( FREQUENCY*t ), where t is the distance the vertex has from that waveCenter.  FREQUENCY is how fast you want the wave to ripple.  You can even make the wave fade out by dividing MAGNITUDE by the distance from the waveCenter.

If a root {x0, y0} lines up with another root {x0, y1}, a linear transformation of the variables can always be found so that moves all the other roots off the line x = x0.  So in principle, this method can be applied to any system.

OP's example

In the OP's case, the command can be simplified a little since x0 == 0:

SparseArray[
   CoefficientList[Resultant[y^4 + 6 x^3*y + x^8, y^2 - x^3, y], x]
 ][""NonzeroPositions""][[1, 1]] - 1
(*
  6
*)


Comparison

I assume the OP wants a method, not just the answer.  (The OP's is simple enough to do, plug in x^3 for y, in one's head after all.)  We compare the NSolve method and @belisarius's Solve method with the Resultant method.

My original method was to use NSolve, which seems to work although the docs do not promise that it will, like this if we add Count as @belisarius did:

Count[NSolve[{p1 == 0, p2 == 0}, {x, y}], {x -&gt; 0.`, y -&gt; 0.`}]


Generalizing @belisarius's answer, I would get something like

Count[Solve[p1 == 0 /. #, x, Reals] &amp; /@ Solve[p2 == 0, y] // Flatten, x -&gt; 0]


which indeed yields 6 on the OP's example.

A more difficult example

Now let's consider the system with y^2 replacing y in the second polynomial:

p = {y^4 + 6 x^3*y + x^8, y^2 - x^3};


The two solve-based methods give different answers:

Count[NSolve[p == {0, 0}, {x, y}], {x -&gt; 0.`, y -&gt; 0.`}]
(* 9 *)

Count[Solve[p[[1]] == 0 /. #, x, Reals] &amp; /@ Solve[p[[2]] == 0, y] // Flatten, x -&gt; 0]
(* 10 *)


One solution gets counted twice in the Solve method, I guess, because the Resultant method yields

SparseArray[CoefficientList[Resultant[p[[1]], p[[2]], y], x]][""NonzeroPositions""][[1, 1]] - 1
(* 9 *)


Failure on repeated x0 - and the workaround

If we add some factors to the OP's system so that {x, y} = {0, 1} is a root, all the current solutions fail to yield 6:

p = {(y^4 + 6 x^3*y + x^8) (x^2 + (y - 1)^2), (y - x^3) (y - 1)};

Count[NSolve[p == {0, 0}, {x, y}], {x -&gt; 0.`, y -&gt; 0.`}]
(* 3 *)

Count[Solve[p[[1]] == 0 /. #, x, Reals] &amp; /@ Solve[p[[2]] == 0, y] // 
  Flatten, x -&gt; 0]
(* 8 *)

SparseArray[CoefficientList[Resultant[p[[1]], p[[2]], y], x]][""NonzeroPositions""][[1, 1]] - 1
(* 8 *)


Edit: Actually NSolve gets close, literally.  Numerical error leads to three of the roots being slightly off:

Count[Chop[NSolve[p == {0, 0}, {x, y}], 10^-50], {x -&gt; 0, y -&gt; 0}]
(* 6 *)


One can also use the Resultant method by transforming the coordinates so that the root {0, 1} is moved off the line x = 0:

With[{p = p /. {x -&gt; x + y, y -&gt; y}},
 SparseArray[CoefficientList[Resultant[p[[1]], p[[2]], y], x]][""NonzeroPositions""][[1, 1]] - 1]
(* 6 *)


Simply switching x and y also works in this case.



Orginal answer -- NSolve gives the correct multiplicity in V10

","General approach

If {x0, y0} is a root of a polynomial system {p1, p2} such that there is no other root of the form {x0, y1}, the multiplicity is given by the multiplicity of the zero x0 of the resultant

Resultant[p1, p2, y]


We can compute the multiplicity of this zero with

SparseArray[
   CoefficientList[Resultant[p1, p2, y] /. x -&gt; x0 + u, u]

If a root {x0, y0} lines up with another root {x0, y1}, a linear transformation of the variables can always be found so that moves all the other roots off the line x = x0.  So in principle, this method can be applied to any system.

",David I.,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/21025,"So if I understood you correctly then you want to dig in the ground, raise the water pipe to a filter, then back down into the ground?

I have to say that doesn't seem like a good idea to me. If I were doing this I would just cut a pipe in the basement and put the filter there. In particular I would cut just the pipe going to the kitchen, and not the whole house.

But if you really want too...

For the enclosure use double layer (4 inches) extruded foam sheets including on the ground! Then cover them in some exterior-grade plywood on the outside to protect from damage.

i.e. build a plywood box without beams/poles inside it (put them on the outside), then glue the foam sheets to the inside. Lay some plastic on the ground with small holes for the pipe, tape the plastic to the pipe, then foam sheets on top of that, and put the whole plywood box on top of it.

You'll probably need a 3rd hole for some sort of support to hold the filters.

I would suggest you wrap the pipe first in electrical heating tape (they sell it to protect pipes from freezing, it's what you want) then in waterproof (i.e. closed cell) foam rated for underground use several inches think and bury it.

",Sergio Campamá,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/3771,"It's not perfectly clear to whether you want a real-time clock or a stopwatch (the 40 seconds you mention).  

You could use an RTC IC (Real-Time Clock), like the NXP PCF8563. This one is available in several packages, including both the old DIL and a very small DFN.
But you probably don't need a separate RTC IC. It's typically used because it consumes very little power, and the rest of the circuit can power down while the RTC keeps running of a battery or supercap. The MSP430, however, is also a low-power device, and it has a low-frequency oscillator which can run on the same 32.768kHz crystal you would use for the RTC.
In one project I had the MSP430 running continuously on a 32kHz crystal, and yet it consumed less than 5\$\mu\$A. That's more than an RTC (the PCF8563 only needs 250nA), but it will be acceptable for many applications.  

What's your problem with the 1s interrupt? If you want to make a real-time clock you'll need a time-cue anyhow, whether generated internally or coming from an external RTC. Upon interrupt you can perform required updates of seconds, minutes and hour counters, and wait for the next interrupt. You even could work with 10ths of a second, although with the 32.768kHz this will have a minor deviation. You would have four tenths of a second or 3277 clock ticks, followed by one tenth of 3278 ticks, to get exactly 1/2 second, so repeat this pattern a second time to complete one second.

3048,3048,4856,Why do objects fall at the same acceleration?,"I read these two posts and now I am more confused.

Do heavier objects fall faster?

Don&#39;t heavier objects actually fall faster because they exert their own gravity?

I was going to ask: if mass is an objects tendency to resist acceleration then why do two objects of different masses fall to the Earth at the same acceleration?

Then I read those posts and it seems that even though it is very small, the more massive object falls faster. Okay I understand, both objects attract each other.

If two cars of different masses collide doesn't the car with less mass accelerate more even though both cars received the same Force. Then that implies you need more force to accelerate a large mass than to accelerate a small mass. Because that is how I see it, the Moon attracts the Earth with the same Force as the Earth attracts the Moon but the Earth accelerates less due to its larger mass.

So then how is mass an object's tendency to resist acceleration? I am aware of $F_1 = F_2 = GMm/r^2$. So should we not really be able to see the difference in acceleration when dropping a massive object?
",CharlieK,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/43959,"I hope this doesn't confuse you, but in one sense, yes, heavier bodies do fall faster than light ones, even in a vacuum. Previous answers are correct in pointing out that if you double the mass of the falling object, the attraction between it and the earth doubles, but since it is twice as massive its acceleration is unchanged. This, however, is true in the frame of reference of the center of mass of the combined bodies. It is also true that the earth is attracted to the falling body, and with twice the mass (of the falling body), the earth's acceleration is twice as large. Therefore, in the earth's frame of reference, a heavy body will fall faster than a light one. 

Granted, for any practical experiment I don't see how you'd measure a difference that small, but in principle it is there.

As other answers have said the first sentence sounds hypothetical. The reason this statement is hypothetical is that the machines being talked about do have energy. With context it might read:



  Of course, all machines are either connected to an electricity supply
  or powered by some other energy source. Machines wouldn't work without
  energy.



The second sentence could either be talking about the future or a present 'habit'. Assuming the idea is to describe a habit that machines have, with context it might read:



  It is common to see machines connected to some kind of power source:
  Machines won't work without energy.



The third sentence is quite similar to the first, this time the emphasis being on hypothetical capability. Machines can function but they only have this capability because of energy.



  Machines are capable of performing amazing tasks but of course they
  need a power source. Machines couldn't work without energy.



The final statement is one of fact about machines' capabilities - true now, true in the past, true always.



  It is impossible for machines to operate unconnected to a power
  supply: Machines can't work without energy.

4246,4246,6768,What is the difference between Cajun and Creole cuisine?,"What is the difference between Cajun and Creole cuisine?
",Cade Roux,https://cooking.stackexchange.com/users/25,"The previously accepted answer contains a good link, but not any information here on Seasoned Advice, so I thought I would write out a few things from my understanding after having developed an abiding interest in Cajun foods over the past decade.

Basically, Creole is a much broader term with a longer history. While it is perhaps inaccurate to say Cajun is a 'subset' area and culinary style, it is more geographically- and flavor-specific than just saying Creole. The history of people and region identified as Creole (on the American continents) goes back a long ways, and Cajun is a more recent phenomenon. Creole can also refer to other peoples and regions other than just in the South/Central parts of North America, though such use in the United States is a distant memory.

Basically, Creole is a much broader term with a longer history. While it is perhaps inaccurate to say Cajun is a 'subset' area and culinary style, it is more geographically- and flavor-specific than just saying Creole. The history of people and region identified as Creole (on the American continents) goes back a long ways, and Cajun is a more recent phenomenon. Creole can also refer to other peoples and regions other than just in the South/Central parts of North America, though such use in the United States is a distant memory.

369,369,582,Shape of rotating rope (lasso problem?),"Let's take a wire or a rope. I usually do this with a chain or my scarf.

I fixate one end in my hand and apply rotation (by subtle movements of this endpoint like spinning a lasso). The rope gets into rotation and obtains certain bent shape:


Some part is missing because cellphone cameras ain't great for high-speed photos but I hope you can imagine all the scarf.

The question is: how can I calculate/predict this shape?

Although this problem doesn't seem that bizarre, I have never seen any solution. Nor I have found this question asked anywhere on internet... Must be because I just don't know how to formulate it without pictures.

Also by taking longer rope I get more than one bend:


I apoligize for the quality again. It is even harder to rotate this while taking picture. The form is not spiral, it is more like a shape in a plane that's rotating.

I'll be thankful for explanations, solutions, links or at least a correct formulation of this problem.
",Džuris,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/12727,"This is not a complete solution but I'm making it a community wiki so that others can supplement and correct it.

Frédéric Grosshans is almost correct in the above, but misses a crucial part of the problem: the rope may coil around the axis. The general method of assuming a stable equilibrium shape and minimising the (effective) potential energy in a rotating frame is a good one, but perhaps one should be wary of assuming that such a stable equilibrium even exists.

Pressing on, we parametrise the rope as $(z(l), r(l), \phi(l))$, and the potential energy is: $$U = \int_0^L dl \; \rho \left(\frac{1}{2} \omega^2 r^2 - g z\right)$$ where $\rho$ is the density per length (apparently irrelevant in the end, but we will keep it to make sure that the units are sane) and we take the convention that $z$ increases downwards.

The constraint is that each small element of the rope must be at a fixed length, so we introduce a Lagrange multiplier field (this is a field theory in 1D!): $$L = \rho \left(\frac{1}{2} \omega^2 r^2 - g z\right) + \frac{1}{2}T\left(r&#39;^2 + z&#39;^2 + r^2 \phi&#39;^2 - 1\right)$$ where $T$ is the Lagrange multiplier field (the name will become obvious, as will the random factor of 1/2).

Pushing through the Euler-Lagrange equations yields:
$$\begin{align*}
\rho g + (Tz&#39;)&#39; &amp;= 0 \\
\rho \omega^2 r + T r \phi&#39;^2 - (Tr&#39;)&#39; &amp;= 0 \\
(T r^2 \phi &#39;)&#39; &amp;= 0 \\
r&#39;^2 + z&#39;^2 + r^2 \phi&#39;^2 &amp;= 1
\end{align*}$$

The first equation encodes the meaning of $T$ as the tension in the rope. We may integrate it and obtain the quite obviously sensible $$Tz&#39; = \rho g (L - l)$$ (using the boundary condition that $T = 0$ at $l = L$) which simply encodes that the vertical component of the tension must balance the weight of the rope below. 

The remaining equations are 1st order in $z$ and 2nd order in $\phi$ and $r$. We have the coordinate setting equations that $z(0) = 0$ and $\phi(0) = 0$. There is a genuine extra parameter $r(0)$ which dictates the radius of the driving force at the top. However, one still needs another boundary condition for $r$ and $\phi$ (or possibly their derivatives) for the problem to be well posed. In addition, the condition for $T$ leads to a tricky integral equation, since the natural boundary condition is that $T(L) = 0$, and one would then need to integrate this to obtain the boundary at $l = 0$. 

Finally, I should mention that this partial solution as it stands has one serious deficiency which may or may not be connected to the boundary condition problem above: the equations are symmetric for $\omega \rightarrow - \omega$, so apparently an available solution would have the rope pointing forwards of the rotating force. But perhaps this is a maximum of the energy rather than the minimum.

In any case, the problem seems highly non-linear, and I would be surprised (and delighted) if an analytic solution is possible. One might hope however that there are easy to understand regimes (apart from the trivial ones at $\omega = 0$ or $\infty$).

One solution I tried was to check whether $TERM was set. But this didn't seem to work; I still got the same error message.  Here's the code:

if [ ! ""$TERM"" = """" ]; then
  #Do stuff here
fi


So apparently $TERM was set, but tput still concluded it wasn't.
","For me, adding 

export TERM=xterm


to /etc/profile was the only thing that solved the problem. Actually, the error gave us a hint: No value for $TERM

",Toby Lawrence,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/9711,"A load dump is what happens to an automobile electrical system when a large load (such as the headlights) switches off. The problem is that the charging system (primarily the alternator) has significant inductance, and any attempt to rapidly reduce the current draw results in an ""inductive kick"" that creates a large voltage spike on the 12V bus. This kick is the same phenomenon used to create the spark in the ignition system, just a different manifestation of it. The point is, any equipment that's attached to the 12V bus needs to be able to withstand these occasional 100-200V voltage spikes without damage.

Since load dump is primarily an inductive phenomenon, it would probably be easier to simulate it that way, too. You don't really need to simulate the full energy of an actual automotive load dump; you just need to create the same voltage waveform across the supply terminals of your device.



Put a largish inductor (L1, on the order of 1H, perhaps the primary of a large power transformer) in series with your device (i.e., connect the device to the power supply through the inductor). This represents the inductance of the automobile charging system.

Put a few &micro;F of capacitance (C1) across (in parallel with) your device; this represents the distributed capacitance of the automobile wiring, and helps to limit the risetime of the load dump event. Make sure this capacitor is rated for a few hundred volts.

Put a 120&Omega; resistor (R1) in parallel with your device, too. This represents other static loads within the automobile, and will set an upper limit on the peak voltage that the load dump creates. (This resistor will be drawing 100 mA and dissipating 1.2W.)

Now, connect a low-value, high-power resistor (R2) across your device, in series with a switch (SW1). This represents the load that is going to get ""dumped"". The value of the resistor should be such that the DC current doesn't exceed the power supply's capability, and you can adjust the value of the resistor to change the current with respect to the value of the inductor to dump a specific amount of energy (0.5&times;I2&times;L). For example, if your inductor is 1H and your resistor is 12&Omega; (@ 12W), you'll be drawing 1A, and the stored energy will be 0.5 Joules.

Close the switch to ""charge up"" the inductor, then open it &mdash; there's your simulated load dump event. With these resistor values, the peak voltage will be on the order of 100-120V. You can use different combinations of resistor values to simulate different kinds of events. The ratio of R1 to R2 approximately determines the peak voltage of the spike (relative to the power supply voltage). Scale both resistors downward to simulate higher-current (higher-energy) events. Make the capacitor smaller to get faster risetimes; 1H and 1&micro;F resonate at 160Hz, which gives you a fairly leisurely 1.5ms risetime (1/4 cycle). For example, changing C1 to 0.01&micro;F would give you a risetime of about 150&micro;s.

3117,3117,4965,Shape of rotating rope (lasso problem?),"Let's take a wire or a rope. I usually do this with a chain or my scarf.

I fixate one end in my hand and apply rotation (by subtle movements of this endpoint like spinning a lasso). The rope gets into rotation and obtains certain bent shape:


Some part is missing because cellphone cameras ain't great for high-speed photos but I hope you can imagine all the scarf.

The question is: how can I calculate/predict this shape?

Although this problem doesn't seem that bizarre, I have never seen any solution. Nor I have found this question asked anywhere on internet... Must be because I just don't know how to formulate it without pictures.

Also by taking longer rope I get more than one bend:


I apoligize for the quality again. It is even harder to rotate this while taking picture. The form is not spiral, it is more like a shape in a plane that's rotating.

I'll be thankful for explanations, solutions, links or at least a correct formulation of this problem.
",Džuris,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/12727,"It's an interesting problem. I've tried to study it neglecting the air friction, which is likely to be nonnegligible. So let's parametrize the rope of length $L$ by the vector $(z(l), r(l))$, with $l$ being the curviligne coordinate along the rope and $(z,r)$ the cylindrical coordinates of the rope (I've omitted $\theta$, which can be assumed to be constant in the rotating frame [see my comment below this post for a justification of this omission]). 
In the rotating frame, the potential energy of the rope is
$$E_p=\int_0^L \mu dl\left(gz-\frac12\Omega^2r^2\right)$$
and the definition of the curviligne integral gives the constraint $r&#39;^2+l&#39;^2=1$. So the problem can be translated into minimizing the following quantity :
$$\begin{align}
 \int_0^Ldl \mathcal L(z,r;z&#39;,r&#39;;l) &amp; &amp;
 \text{with } \mathcal L(z,r;z&#39;,r&#39;;l)=\mu gz - \tfrac12\mu\Omega^2r^2 - \lambda(z&#39;^2+r&#39;^2).
\end{align}$$
One should not forget (as I did in a first tentative answer) that the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ depends on $l$/
It is a standard Euler-Lagrange problem and its solution is given by
$$\begin{align}
 \frac{\partial\mathcal L}{\partial z}-\frac{d}{dl}\frac{\partial\mathcal L}{\partial z}&amp;=0&amp;
&amp;\text{and}&amp;
 \frac{\partial\mathcal L}{\partial r}-\frac{d}{dl}\frac{\partial\mathcal L}{\partial r}&amp;=0&amp;
\end{align}$$
The equation in $z$ becomes
$$\begin{align}
\mu g&amp;=-2\frac{d}{dl}(\lambda z&#39;)&amp;
\lambda z&#39;&amp;= -\tfrac12 \mu g(l-l_0),
\end{align}$$
where $l_0$ is an integration constant. For the optimal solution $z&#39;\le 0$, since replacing $z&#39; by -|z&#39;|$ can only decrease $\mathcal L$, ans we have $z&#39;=-\sqrt{1-r&#39;^2}$. One has therefore
$$\lambda=\frac{\mu g(l-l_0)}{2\sqrt{1-r&#39;^2}}$$.
The equation in $r$ is then
$$-\mu\Omega^2r=-2\frac{d}{dl}(\lambda r&#39;) =-\frac{d}{dl}\frac{\mu g(l-l_0)r&#39;}{\sqrt{1-r&#39;^2}}$$
We have then the following equation to integrate
$$0=\frac{\Omega^2}{g}r(1-r&#39;^2)^{3/2}-r&#39;(1-r&#39;^2)-(l-l_0)r&#39;&#39;.$$
I don't know how to integrate it analytically, but when $l-l_0&lt;0$, it seems that we can have oscillations.

Edited to add :

If one looks at the signs of $r&#39;$ and $r&#39;&#39;$ as function of $r$ and $r&#39;$ for a fixed $l$, one can quickly draw some arrows in phase space (i.e.) and see that the flow goes ""in circles"" when $l&lt;l_0$ and tends asymptotically to the curve $\frac{\Omega^2}{g}r=\frac{r&#39;}{\sqrt{1-r&#39;^2}}$ when $l&gt;l0$. So one can expect a finite number of oscillations of the rope. But the whole question is then how $l_0$ relates to the parameters of the system.

Edit: In the limit of almost vertical rope ($r'\ll1$), the equation becomes
$$0=\frac{\Omega^2}{g}r-r&#39;-(l-l_0)r&#39;&#39;$$
which is simpler. And indeed, Wolfram Alpha has an analytical solution using modified Bessel functions.

Entity2 primary key is composed by a simple generated value + the id of entity one (with a many to one relationship)


Unfortunately, I can't make it work.

Here is an excerpt of the code:

@Entity
public class Entity1 {

 @Id @GeneratedValue
 private Long id;

 private String name;

    ...
}

@Entity
public class Entity2 {

 @EmbeddedId
 private Entity2PK pk = new Entity2PK();

 private String miscData;

    ...
}

@Embeddable
public class Entity2PK implements Serializable {

 @GeneratedValue
 private Long id;

 @ManyToOne
 private Entity1 entity;
}

void test() {

    Entity1 e1 = new Entity1();
    e1.setName(""nameE1"");
    Entity2 e2 = new Entity2();

    e2.setEntity1(e1);
    e2.setMiscData(""test"");

    Transaction transaction = session.getTransaction();
    try {
     transaction.begin();

     session.save(e1);
     session.save(e2);

     transaction.commit();
    } catch (Exception e) {
     transaction.rollback();
    } finally {
     session.close();
    }
}


When I run the test method I get the following errors:

Hibernate: insert into Entity1 (id, name) values (null, ?)
Hibernate: call identity()
Hibernate: insert into Entity2 (miscData, entity_id, id) values (?, ?, ?)

Any ideas about what is wrong ?
","You can use foreign key in embedded id as a separate read-only column:

@Entity 
public class Entity2 { 

    @EmbeddedId 
    private Entity2PK pk = new Entity2PK(); 

    @ManyToOne 
    @JoinColumn(name = ""entity1_id"")
    private Entity1 entity;

5705,5705,9043,Set natbib options after loading natbib package,"Is it possible to set (or change) the natbib package options after its loading (i.e. after the line \usepackage{natbib})?

The reason I need it is that I'm using a LaTeX style from a journal and it has a natbib option which means it ""...handles reference entries in the author-year system by using the natbib package"", according to the journal style documentation, and I need to tune some settings (like 'sort&amp;compress', for example), but I do not know how to do that since I do not load the 'natbib' package directly.

For investigate further, we debug class DigestSignatureSpi that Bouncy Castle use to verify at line

try
{
    sig = cipher.processBlock(sigBytes, 0, sigBytes.length);

    expected = derEncode(hash);
}
catch (Exception e)
{
    return false;
}


sig is

[48, 33, 48, 9, 6, 5, 43, 14, 3, 2, 26, 5, 0, 4, 20, 40, -70, 110, -94, 52, 100, -33, 111, 101, 111, -17, -68, 8, 82, -109, 20, 0, -31, -5, 119]


while expected is

[40, -70, 110, -94, 52, 100, -33, 111, 101, 111, -17, -68, 8, 82, -109, 20, 0, -31, -5, 119]


This debug show sig include expected bit (last 20 bytes).

I don't know what is wrong. PLEASE HELP!!! Thank you.
",Lê Đình Quang,https://stackoverflow.com/users/3395712,"I think you should change it to Signature verifyEngine = Signature.getInstance(""NoneWithRSA""); and it should work. As far as I rember that one returns the digest and not a DigestInfo structure.

Net","We have old system using .NET 3.5 (run on Windows Server 2003 32bits) to verify e-receipts from our customers (all use SHA1RSA algorithm as agreement). We store their certificates in database in Base64 string. Old code look like that:

//Store certificates
String certificateEncodeBase64 = Convert.ToBase64String(byteArrayCertificateFile);

//Verify signatures

//Hash algorithm SHA-1
HashAlgorithm hashAlgrothm = new SHA1Managed();
//Data
byte[] data = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(request.DataInUTF8);
//Signature
byte[] signature = Convert.FromBase64String(request.SignatureInBase64);
//Certificate
X509Certificate2 certificate = new X509Certificate2(Convert.FromBase64String(certEncodeBase64));
//Verify using algorithm RSA
RSACryptoServiceProvider pubKey = (RSACryptoServiceProvider)certificate.PublicKey.Key    
bool vr = pubKey.VerifyData(data, hashAlgrothm, signature);


Nothing issues except the performance is not good. That's why we want to move to new system using Java 1.7 (run on Windows Server 2012 64 bits). Our new code look like that:

//Using the same DB store certificates

//Verify signatures using Bouncy Castle JCE Provider

//Hash data using SHA-1
byte[] data_ = request.getDataInUTF8().getBytes(""UTF-8"");
MessageDigest messageDigest_ = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-1"", ""BC"");
byte[] hashed = messageDigest.digest(data);
//Signature
byte [] signature = new BASE64Decoder().decodeBuffer(request.getSignatureInBase64());
//Certificate
CertificateFactory certificateFactory = CertificateFactory.getInstance(""X509"", ""BC"");
byte[] buffer = new BASE64Decoder().decodeBuffer(certEncodeBase64);
ByteArrayInputStream byteArrayCertificateInputStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(buffer);
Certificate certificate = certificateFactory.generateCertificate(byteArrayCertificateInputStream);
//Verify using algorithm RSA
Signature verifyEngine = Signature.getInstance(""RSA"", ""BC"");
verifyEngine.initVerify(certificate);
verifyEngine.update(hashed);
result = verifyEngine.verify(signature);


And we get this problem: In our test using all verified data taken from old system, new system verify some customer's data but some customers always return fail.

",bakriawad,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/78036,"I'm afraid Electricity Doesn't Work That Way. A linear regulator is basically a resistor that varies its resistance based on the load drawn, to always keep a consistent voltage. In parallel with that you've put some resistors (and note, multiple parallel resistors are equivalent to one resistor with 1/nth the resistance).

What will actually happen in your circuit is this: if the load is large, current will be drawn via your extra resistors until the voltage across them is such that the side closest to the load is at the voltage provided by the voltage regulator. Any additional current will be drawn through the voltage regulator. Together, your resistors and the voltage regulator will dissipate exactly as much waste power (and heat) as a regulator alone would.

If the load is small, the voltage across your resistors will be small, and the voltage on the output will thus be large - up to the input voltage minus the diode's forward voltage, at no load - and the linear regulator will shut off completely, vainly trying to reduce the voltage by limiting the current through it.

Thus, what you've created is a sort of ""lower bound voltage regulator"", which provides a voltage between the input voltage and the set voltage at low currents, and exactly the set voltage at high currents, up to the limit of what your regulator plus resistors can dissipate.

There are well established solutions for converting voltages at high current with low waste, called switching regulators. They work by repeatedly charging up an inductor - a coil of wire - and discharging it into a capacitor, which serves to convert from one voltage to another with minimal waste.

And the result of this accepted method dates dinosaur fossils to around 68 million years old.

However:
Consider the C-14 decay rate. Its half-life ($t_{1/2}$) is only 5,730 years—that is, every 5,730 years, half of it decays away. The theoretical limit for C-14 dating is 100,000 years using AMS, but for practical purposes it is 45,000 to 55,000 years. If dinosaur bones are 65 million years old, there should not be one atom of C-14 left in them.

Dinosaurs are not dated with Carbon-14, yet some researchers have claimed that there is still Carbon-14 in the bones.

So what needs to be done about this inconsistency? Do these data indicate that a more accurate method needs to be derived? What solutions are available for increasing accuracy of the tests? Or do we need another dating method all together?

Considering Contamination

From the source linked above:


  Carbon-14 is considered to be a highly reliable dating technique.  It's accuracy has been verified by using C-14 to date artifacts whose age is known historically. The fluctuation of the amount of C-14 in the atmosphere over time adds a small uncertainty, but contamination by ""modern carbon"" such as decayed organic matter from soils poses a greater possibility for error.
  
  Dr. Thomas Seiler, a physicist from Germany, gave the presentation in Singapore.  He said that his team and the laboratories they employed took special care to avoid contamination. That included protecting the samples, avoiding cracked areas in the bones, and meticulous pre-cleaning of the samples with chemicals to remove possible contaminants.  Knowing that small concentrations of collagen can attract contamination, they compared precision Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) tests of collagen and bioapatite (hard carbonate bone mineral) with conventional counting methods of large bone fragments from the same dinosaurs. ""Comparing such different molecules as minerals and organics from the same bone region, we obtained concordant C-14 results which were well below the upper limits of C-14 dating. These, together with many other remarkable concordances between samples from different fossils, geographic regions and stratigraphic positions make random contamination as origin of the C-14 unlikely"".

",Decrypted,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/52046,"I actually happen to know something about the ""Miller Tale"" as it is called. Miller ""borrowed"" some dinosaur bones from a museum without telling the curators or owners what he was actually intending on doing with it. He immediately took it to be $^{14}C$ dated and received a date of roughly 40,000 years. So if Dinosaur bones are supposedly 65+ million years old, why is this? I'll tell you why.

The dinosaur bones did NOT have any carbon in them. They'd been essentially completely replaced by minerals during the fossilization process. What happened was that Miller did NOT know that they were covered in a preservative made of an organic material called shellac, which is organic so it's full of carbon. This contaminated the result. What they got was a date for the shellac, not the dinosaur fossils.

Onto your questions:


So what research is being done to correct such an obvious dating flaw?
The flaw is with creationists. We've been trying to educate creationists for decades now, but willful ignorance in favor of adhering to tradition and presuppositions is far stronger than anything that can be taught.
Using this data, can a more accurate method be derived?
Yes! We have dozens of independent dating methods that have accurately dated the layers of dinosaur fossils to a very high degree of accuracy. We have also used isochron dating to test for contamination and/or how well the rocks acted as closed systems.
Or do we need another dating method all together?
Carbon dating is very accurate. I recommend you check out This Paper from 1949. It shows that objects of known age via independent methods and recordings are corroborated by carbon dating.
At what extremes of failure does it take for a scientifically approved method to become nonscientific?
At the point at which it can be shown to be false and lack point of predictive capability. An ignorant creationist who lacks an understanding of radiometric dating does not constitute evidence against a well-established and well-understood process.
And what does it say about science if dating something as 65 million years old when it is less then 100,000 years old becomes an acceptable margin of error?
I'd answer this if it were true. Unfortunately, as I said, the ignorance of creationists does not constitute evidence against radiometric dating by any stretch of the imagination.


I know this was incredibly simple and largely unscientific, but I'm dealing only with your creationist claim. I didn't know this claim was still out there. Got any other questions on radiometric dating?

Replace with new sill
Cut existing sill flush with wall

1221,1221,1916,How to synchronize actions like jump in multiplayer?,"I am a newbie game developer and I have been researching about multiplayer games. I observed that there's always some latency, the players always get updates from past actions. But there are techniques like dead reckoning to handle the latency. I can predict the movement and make movements smooth. But how would I make actions synchronize like jumping, stopped walking, etc.

Suppose, client A was moving, he was at 100m at 10.2 time with 100m/sec velocity and sended this information. Client B would receive this information somewhat later, let it be 10.4. So at client B, I can use prediction and place client A at 120m. But what if, client made a jump at 110m at 10.3. I can't predict that and since I have been using prediction I can't show client A jump in past.

I may deal with this problem by not sending jump action at all. But what if my game has some voids where players can fall and die. So, If I don't sync jump actions, other players will observe that one player was running then he falls in void and then again appear on the screen destroying the visual engagement. 

Jump is just an example, there might many scenarios where prediction can't work. So, How do deal with them. One such example can be Multiplayer Online battle arena games like Awesomenauts.

I observed that there's always some latency, the players always get updates from past actions. But there are techniques like dead reckoning to handle the latency. I can predict the movement and make movements smooth. But how would I make actions synchronize like jumping, stopped walking, etc.

Suppose, client A was moving, he was at 100m at 10.2 time with 100m/sec velocity and sended this information. Client B would receive this information somewhat later, let it be 10.4. So at client B, I can use prediction and place client A at 120m. But what if, client made a jump at 110m at 10.3. I can't predict that and since I have been using prediction I can't show client A jump in past.

I may deal with this problem by not sending jump action at all. But what if my game has some voids where players can fall and die. So, If I don't sync jump actions, other players will observe that one player was running then he falls in void and then again appear on the screen destroying the visual engagement. 

Jump is just an example, there might many scenarios where prediction can't work. So, How do deal with them. One such example can be Multiplayer Online battle arena games like Awesomenauts.

I fixate one end in my hand and apply rotation (by subtle movements of this endpoint like spinning a lasso). The rope gets into rotation and obtains certain bent shape:


Some part is missing because cellphone cameras ain't great for high-speed photos but I hope you can imagine all the scarf.

The question is: how can I calculate/predict this shape?

Although this problem doesn't seem that bizarre, I have never seen any solution. Nor I have found this question asked anywhere on internet... Must be because I just don't know how to formulate it without pictures.

Also by taking longer rope I get more than one bend:


I apoligize for the quality again. It is even harder to rotate this while taking picture. The form is not spiral, it is more like a shape in a plane that's rotating.

I'll be thankful for explanations, solutions, links or at least a correct formulation of this problem.

I usually do this with a chain or my scarf.

I fixate one end in my hand and apply rotation (by subtle movements of this endpoint like spinning a lasso). The rope gets into rotation and obtains certain bent shape:


Some part is missing because cellphone cameras ain't great for high-speed photos but I hope you can imagine all the scarf.

The question is: how can I calculate/predict this shape?

Although this problem doesn't seem that bizarre, I have never seen any solution. Nor I have found this question asked anywhere on internet... Must be because I just don't know how to formulate it without pictures.

Also by taking longer rope I get more than one bend:


I apoligize for the quality again. It is even harder to rotate this while taking picture. The form is not spiral, it is more like a shape in a plane that's rotating.

I'll be thankful for explanations, solutions, links or at least a correct formulation of this problem.
","It will be some sort of hyperbolic function, and the force and length of rope will determine the frequency to predict the shape.  The initial 'circle' at your wrist will define the constant force to explain the sin curve.  This is not a very good explanation but if you were to define a hyperbolic function using a z axis it could be sinh z=(e^z-e^-z)/2.

if someone shows me how to fix this i will be very greatful
thanks

      i mean listen port, min max

if someone shows me how to fix this i will be very greatful
thanks 
","Either pasv_address needs to be the external IP address, or pasv_addr_resolve=YES needs to be set so that the hostname you entered will be resolved when vsftpd starts.  If you use a hostname with pasv_addr_resolve, vsftpd has to be restarted if the IP address changes.

5501,5501,8729,Was there confirmed opposition to Willow's relationship in Buffy season 5?,"In season five of Buffy the Vampire Slayer 


   Tara and Willow pursue a romantic relationship


There's lots of hugging and smiling and talking about their feelings, but up to the sixth episode, they do not kiss.  Was there studio/PR/political objection to the nature of this relationship?  How much?  What was the nature of it- was it deemed too controversial, inappropriate for younger viewers, were executives worried that it would perform poorly? 
",Adele C,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/3576,"According to The Strange And Incredible Saga Of Willow and Tara On ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", there was initially at least some backlash from some fans about the relationship.


  The storyline received a great deal of attention in the press and sparked a controversy that divided the show’s most loyal fan base. In fact, Amber Benson who played Tara experienced first hand just how nasty the fans could get. She would visit the Buffy posting boards on the web on a regular basis and discover that negative comments were not only being made about the Willow/Tara relationship in general, but that the fans were targeting both the character of Tara as well as Amber Benson herself. “It was just so surreal to have people using my name and Tara’s name interchangeably and saying nasty things about both,” she said in the October 2000 issue of the English Science Fiction/horror magazine Dreamwatch. Benson also went on to say in the interview that ” it hurt for people to make nasty comments about Willow and Tara’s relationship and about my weight and what I looked like as a whole. Whether someone says that your ugly to your face or on a posting board, it still hurts horribly. I mean, you wouldn’t just go over to Joe Blow and say, ‘I think you’re a fat, ugly sexual pervert.” Almost immediately websites showing their support for Benson began popping up all over the web . “I have gotten so many supportive letters from fans,” Benson said. They have been so kind, she said. “they make me feel better about everything , especially when they share their experiences. They make me realize that I am not alone. We are all beautiful no matter what we look like on the outside.”


The article also goes on to explain why there was no on-screen kiss between Willow and Tara until season 6.


  Hannigan also went on to talk in the interview about how the WB network would not allow an onscreen kiss between the two actresses ” In America we’ve not been allowed to have the kiss on screen. As actors, we sometimes get the squished down version of reactions, so it could be that The Powers That Be are freaking, but to us it doesn’t seem like a big deal. The show goes out at 8:00 p.m., the first hour of prime time. If it went out at 9:00 p.m., we could probably show a kiss, but why bother ? I don’t think we need to see it. It’s just the annoying fact that we see Buffy and Riley having full--- on sex all day and all night (in Where The Wild Things Are.), but these two girls can’t even kiss ?”


The show moved from the WB to UPN after season 5, so apparently that network was a little bit more progressive-minded about the relationship.

2683,2683,4277,Measuring Resistance of a Wire With an ADC,"I'm trying to design a circuit which can measure small resistances down to 0.1 Ohm and a max. of 10 Ohms. I won't be measuring actual resistors but rather large coil of wires, upto 500 m (as you can imagine, these wires are quite thick).

Here's the circuit I came up with:


The circuit works by maintaining a constant current through the device under test, R2. With a current of 100 mA, R2 would develop a voltage between 10 mV to 50 mV.

I think in an ideal world this would work but in practice I may have a hard time measuring 0.1 Ohms with this - mainly due to the ADC. Let's assume the ADC is 10-bit with VREF of 5V. This translates to 5mV per step. If R2 = 0.1 and Iout = 100 mA, then the voltage present at the ADC would be 50 mV - but I'm not sure how buried under noise this would be.

My question is, should I increase the gain to, say, 50. If the gain is 50, then the voltage present at the ADC would be 500 mV - but the max. measurable resistance would be 1 Ohms. To measure 10 Ohms, I would need to lower the current to 10 mA instead of 100 mA. A way to do that would be use an FET to switch out R1 and connect a 20 Ohm resistor at Iout.

I don't need the circuit to measure the resistance precisely - a tolerance of +/- 10% is fine.
",Saad,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/3966,"First of all, this setup will not allow you to get a range of 0÷5V at the ADC input.

",Saad,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/3966,"Ok, you asked for my version of the circuit.




This uses an opamp+BJT current source with a three-decade range.  The range of the current source is selected by grounding one of three resistors.  You can probably achieve your accuracy goals by using AVR outputs to switch the three resistors.  Switch between output low (for enable) or input (for disable).  Analog input is better, but the voltage will be an unambigious high, so digital input is OK.  For better accuracy, connect the 4K to resistor to two pins.  The output resistance of an AVR digital out is about 25 ohms: 

.
The +5V line is used for the reference of both the current source and ADC.  Variations in supply voltage will cancel.  The alternative would be to have a reference in the current source and a reference in the ADC... not necessary here.  Microcontroller ADCs are generally happy to use the supply rails as reference.
You must make four connections to the device under test.  Two of the connections deliver the current, and two of the connections present the voltage across the device under test to the measurement circuit.  Four-wire connection is necessary to measure low resistances ( &lt; 1 ohm )!  Otherwise you are measuring your probe resistance by accident.

If your probe resistance is higher than about an ohm, you should go for the full instrumentation amplifier.  But with reasonable probes this should meet spec as-is.

I won't be measuring actual resistors but rather large coil of wires, upto 500 m (as you can imagine, these wires are quite thick).

Here's the circuit I came up with:


The circuit works by maintaining a constant current through the device under test, R2. With a current of 100 mA, R2 would develop a voltage between 10 mV to 50 mV.

I think in an ideal world this would work but in practice I may have a hard time measuring 0.1 Ohms with this - mainly due to the ADC. Let's assume the ADC is 10-bit with VREF of 5V. This translates to 5mV per step. If R2 = 0.1 and Iout = 100 mA, then the voltage present at the ADC would be 50 mV - but I'm not sure how buried under noise this would be.

My question is, should I increase the gain to, say, 50. If the gain is 50, then the voltage present at the ADC would be 500 mV - but the max. measurable resistance would be 1 Ohms. To measure 10 Ohms, I would need to lower the current to 10 mA instead of 100 mA. A way to do that would be use an FET to switch out R1 and connect a 20 Ohm resistor at Iout.

I don't need the circuit to measure the resistance precisely - a tolerance of +/- 10% is fine.
","Ok, you asked for my version of the circuit.




This uses an opamp+BJT current source with a three-decade range.  The range of the current source is selected by grounding one of three resistors.  You can probably achieve your accuracy goals by using AVR outputs to switch the three resistors.  Switch between output low (for enable) or input (for disable).  Analog input is better, but the voltage will be an unambigious high, so digital input is OK.  For better accuracy, connect the 4K to resistor to two pins.  The output resistance of an AVR digital out is about 25 ohms: 

.
The +5V line is used for the reference of both the current source and ADC.  Variations in supply voltage will cancel.  The alternative would be to have a reference in the current source and a reference in the ADC... not necessary here.  Microcontroller ADCs are generally happy to use the supply rails as reference.
You must make four connections to the device under test.  Two of the connections deliver the current, and two of the connections present the voltage across the device under test to the measurement circuit.  Four-wire connection is necessary to measure low resistances ( &lt; 1 ohm )!  Otherwise you are measuring your probe resistance by accident.
The opamp's offset voltage is the most important parameter.  Use a chopper amp and don't worry about it.  I've spec'd OPA2333, which is a nice slow amplifier that's always worked well for me.
If your probe resistance is higher than about an ohm, you should go for the full instrumentation amplifier.  But with reasonable probes this should meet spec as-is.

",raj,https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/4219,"StoneyB's answer is really excellent and I will only add a few words to his keyword imitation.

Imitation includes mimicking. When you learn a foreign language you are playing a part. So listen and watch as much as you can when natives speak. Speaking certain sounds is a complex activity that necessitates to place your phonatory  organs in a particular way (lips, tongue, cheeks...), and it is all the more difficult when wanting to produce sounds that don't exist in your native language. And don't hesitate to exaggerate the mimicking in the first steps of the exercises. I'll take the example of my native language French ; the French often have difficulties saying dental consonants  /θ/ and /ð/, so I used to tell the kids I taught  not to hesitate to stick out their tongues at me when saying it.

Obviously one doesn't always have natives at hands that one can imitate. For a motivated adult I'll recommend English Pronunciation/Listening on the website of this Canadian College. It is really very good with videos in which you can see people pronouncing some of the difficult sounds specific to English, and diagrams of the phonatory organs, face and profile, as well as exercises with mp3 recorded files.  

Another useful site with videos and diagrams is on the website of The University of Iowa.

The whole body is used in speaking, not only the phonatory organs. When speaking an English person, a German person or a Chinese person will not make the same body movements. Trying to imitate the hands, torso, head, shoulders, etc. movements will have you fit into the native speaker's shoes, and be more like him and come closer to your imitation of sound producing.

They all told me that your Indian English accent is hard to understand.","StoneyB's answer is really excellent and I will only add a few words to his keyword imitation.

Imitation includes mimicking. When you learn a foreign language you are playing a part. So listen and watch as much as you can when natives speak. Speaking certain sounds is a complex activity that necessitates to place your phonatory  organs in a particular way (lips, tongue, cheeks...), and it is all the more difficult when wanting to produce sounds that don't exist in your native language. And don't hesitate to exaggerate the mimicking in the first steps of the exercises. I'll take the example of my native language French ; the French often have difficulties saying dental consonants  /θ/ and /ð/, so I used to tell the kids I taught  not to hesitate to stick out their tongues at me when saying it. They loved it of course, but as they became more confident and at ease they would forget the tongue sticking bit but still keep the reflex of not sticking the tip of their tongue on the upper part of their palate, but have it slightly protrude between their upper and lower teeth.

After a Windows 2008 Server R2 clean install I created a couple of local user accounts and joined them to the administrators group, I tested them and I was able to log on with each one.

Then I installed Active Diectory role (DNS role implied) and runned DCPromo. The domain was created and promoted succesfully and I was able to log on into the domain from a client machine.

The issue began when I realized that I was no longer able to log on locally into the server (meaning LOCALMACHINE\localusername). I looked into domain user accounts and noticed that the local user accounts I created previously were now part of the domain. I consider a bad thing not being able to log on locally anymore, so in a shot to fix it I stopped the Active Directory service... my bad! Now I'm sort of locked up, I can't log either locally or as part of the domain.

1031,1031,1622,Analytical solution to PDE,"I am trying to solve the following linear pde where $u=f(x,y)$ in the domain $y \in  (0,\infty)$: 
$$y\dfrac{\partial{u}}{\partial x} = \dfrac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}$$
with boundary conditions: 
$$u(x,0)=\sin(x) $$ 
$$\lim_{y \rightarrow \infty} u(x,y) = 0 .$$

Can someone please suggest how do I proceed to get the analytical solution for this equation? 



Solution: 

Using method of separation of variables, 
we assume solution to be of the form: $$u(x,y)=X(x).Y(y) $$
Inserting this to the pde, we get: 
$$yX'Y=XY'' $$
$$\dfrac{X'}{X}=\dfrac{Y''}{yY}=-\lambda$$
Now we get the following ode's 
$$X'+\lambda X=0 $$
$$Y'' + \lambda y Y = 0 $$

from which we get two general solutions of the following form: 
$$X(x) = c_1\exp(-\lambda x) \qquad Y(y) = c_2Ai(\lambda^{1/3} y) + c_3Bi(\lambda^{1/3} y)  $$ where $Ai$ and $Bi $ are Airy's functions and the general solution can be expressed as: 
$$u(x,y) =  c_1\exp(-\lambda x).(c_2Ai(\lambda^{1/3} y) + c_3Bi(\lambda^{1/3} y))$$

$c_3 \rightarrow 0 $ to satisfy second boundary condition since $Bi(\infty) \rightarrow \infty $ and hence, solution is of the form: 

$$u(x,y) = A \exp(-\lambda x) Ai(\lambda^{1/3} y) $$
Putting $y=0$, 
$$u(x,0) = A\exp(-\lambda x).\dfrac{1}{3^{2/3}}\Gamma({2/3}) = \sin(x) $$

How should I now proceed to find $A$ and $\lambda$, considering that $\lambda$ needs to be positive real value?

These are two ODEs in Y and X

Can you suggest any improvements of this algorithm? I tried following from here, especially ""ultimate solution"" all the way to the bottom of that page, hoping to reduce the number of for loops one within another, but it did not work.

",GianniTee,https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/34915,"Naming naming naming

Your code is very intimidating - it is filled with single letter variable and members (s,h,e,d...). Those which are not single letter are generic and unhelpful (temp, buffer, notamount...). This makes your code very unreadable.

You also use a lot of literal numbers (2, 256, 1072632447, 60801...) which make no sense to a person who is not familiar with your algorithm. Use constants to make your code more readable.

Your comments are also not useful for someone to read and understand your code.

If you want a serious code review, you must make your code readable, break large methods (operate) into smaller ones, etc.

","Naming naming naming

Your code is very intimidating - it is filled with single letter variable and members (s,h,e,d...). Those which are not single letter are generic and unhelpful (temp, buffer, notamount...). This makes your code very unreadable.

You also use a lot of literal numbers (2, 256, 1072632447, 60801...) which make no sense to a person who is not familiar with your algorithm. Use constants to make your code more readable.

Your comments are also not useful for someone to read and understand your code.

If you want a serious code review, you must make your code readable, break large methods (operate) into smaller ones, etc.

As you can see, the address of desc->version is actually 0xc (12), which is the length of the first string. So it looks like the struct that gets packed into the library also contains the string length after the memory address.

Am I using the wrong string type here? As you can see I had to also make the strings NULL terminated manually. I tried to use the CString wrapper but that does not seem to work in this case (""static items are not allowed to have destructors"").

1483,1483,2332,Why won't osm2po setup table correctly?,"OK, I have no idea what's going on. I'm using a Mac and successfully installed pgRouting. I used osm2po on some data, which created a sql file. I imported the sql file into a pgRouting database and all is well, except the fact I only took into account routes for cars.

After Carsten helped me with configuring osm2po.config, I ran osm2po again that ran as expected.

From the terminal, I run the command:

psql -U [username] -d [dbname] -q -f ""/Users/John/Desktop/osm2po-4.6.9/wmCar/wmCar/wmCar_2po_4pgr.sql


I was expecting it to be successful like last time, as to my knowledge the conditions are the same. However I get the error:

With pgAdmin I look at the empty table that was created, and compared to the first sql file I imported, the new table was missing a column. That being geom_way. I find this odd as I haven't changed anything. I threw osm2po folder to the trash, and unzipped a new osm2po folder. To test whether it was going to work, I ran osm2po on the original pbf file with the original osm2po.config settings and tried to import that into the same pgRouting database. The error appeared again. For some reason, the last column, geom_way, isn't being added to the table.

Would anyone know why it's started doing this?

5256,5256,8357,VB.NET multi threading and system architecture,"I believe I have a reasonable understanding of threading from an Object Oriented perspective using the Thread class and the Runnable interface.  In one of my applications there is a ""download"" button that allows the user to run a task in the background that takes about half an hour whilst continuing to use the VB.NET application.

However, I do not understand how Threading maps to the physical architecture of a computer.  If you have a single threaded application that runs on a PC with a quadcore processor then does a .net program use all four processors?

If you have a multi threaded application (say four threads) on a quadcore processor then does each thread execute on different cores?

Do you have any control of this as a developer? 

I have referenced a book I read at university called Operating System Concepts, but I have not found a specific answer.

  If you have a single threaded application that runs on a PC with a quadcore processor then does a .net program use all four processors?


No, it can’t, at least not simultaneously. However, it’s theoretically possible that the operating system’s scheduler first executes your thread on one processor and later moves it to another processor. Such a scheduler is necessary to allow simultaneously running more applications / threads than there are physical processors present: execution of a thread is sliced into small pieces, which are fed to the processor(s) one after the other. Each threads gets some time slice allocated during which it can calculate before usage of the CPU switches to another thread.


  Do you have any control of this as a developer?


Not directly. What you can control is the priority of your thread to make it more important to the task scheduler.

On a more general note, you should not use threads in your use-case – at least not directly. Threads are actually pretty low-level primitives. For your specific use-case, there’s a component called BackgroundWorker which abstracts many of the low-level details of thread management for you.


  If you have a multi threaded application (say four threads) on a quadcore processor then does each thread execute on different cores?


Not necessarily; again, the application has next to no control over how exactly its threads are executed; the operating system however tries really hard to schedule threads “smartly”. This means that in practice, if your application has several busy threads, they are spread out as evenly as possible across the available cores. In particular, if there are no more threads than cores then each thread gets its own core.

In one of my applications there is a ""download"" button that allows the user to run a task in the background that takes about half an hour whilst continuing to use the VB.NET application.

However, I do not understand how Threading maps to the physical architecture of a computer.  If you have a single threaded application that runs on a PC with a quadcore processor then does a .net program use all four processors?

If you have a multi threaded application (say four threads) on a quadcore processor then does each thread execute on different cores?

No, it can’t, at least not simultaneously. However, it’s theoretically possible that the operating system’s scheduler first executes your thread on one processor and later moves it to another processor. Such a scheduler is necessary to allow simultaneously running more applications / threads than there are physical processors present: execution of a thread is sliced into small pieces, which are fed to the processor(s) one after the other. Each threads gets some time slice allocated during which it can calculate before usage of the CPU switches to another thread.

RPi would only recognize the first partition. 

So, I tried creating the partitions using the raspberrypi. Here are my surprising findings:

First, /dev/sda is NOT recognized correctly! This disk is 500GB. 

Second, mounting /dev/sda2 is not possible:

root@raspberrypi:/home/ozn# mount -t ext4 /dev/sda2 /media/usbhdd1/
mount: special device /dev/sda2 does not exist
# although fdisk -l showed this device !


Third, trying to format the disk, it really sees only the sectors until 320GB:
When I start fdisk I am warned:

Command (m for help): w
The partition table has been altered!

I have other USB hard drives with 320GB and they really mount fine. 


Is this a limitation of RPi? Or a problem with this specific Hard Drive?   
How can I use this large disk with my RPi? 


update: solved the issue with help of the commentators here...

here is what I did ...


I thought I have some weired issue with Debian Wheezy &amp; gparted. So, I reformatted the hard drive to NTFS. Before that I ERASED the partition table. 
And created a new single NTFS partition. 
Bingo! RPi, identified the partition. However, it claimed my Drive is now 2TB big, and recommended I will use GPT:

root@raspberrypi:/home/ozn# fdisk -l /dev/sda

whoops! That is WRONG!

So, I disconnected the hard drive again. re-connented it to my laptop. I erased the partition table again, and re-created the partition table using fdisk on RPi! not on my laptop! This time, I took a short cut, and created the disk partition with ext4 directly. 
    I plugged the hard-drive to RPi and BINGO!

conclusion (?)

My guess is that gparted in Debian Wheezy includes some nasty bug which is sometimes showing it's ugly face. I would report a bug if I had more solid evidence. But ... since I have only one 500GB hard drive, and I don't want to
risk the health of this hard drive reformatting it so many time, I will settle this with it. If you happen to bump into this post, and you have had similar problems with large SATA drives and partitioning on wheezy, I would be happy to know.
",Oz123,https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/users/3505,"Basically instead of fdisk -l, you should use parted -l (install parted if you do not have it installed) to see the actual data partition and then mount the actual data partition (/dev/sdb2, etc) directly.

I wrote a short tutorial on how to do this:

Disk /dev/mmcblk0: 4025 MB, 4025483264 bytes
4 heads, 16 sectors/track, 122848 cylinders, total 7862272 sectors

/dev/mmcblk0p2          122880     7862271     3869696   83  Linux

Disk /dev/sda: 320.1 GB, 320072933376 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 38913 cylinders, total 625142448 sectors

/dev/sda2       625142448   976773167   175815360   83  Linux


First, /dev/sda is NOT recognized correctly! This disk is 500GB. 

Second, mounting /dev/sda2 is not possible:

root@raspberrypi:/home/ozn# mount -t ext4 /dev/sda2 /media/usbhdd1/
mount: special device /dev/sda2 does not exist
# although fdisk -l showed this device !


Third, trying to format the disk, it really sees only the sectors until 320GB:
When I start fdisk I am warned:

Building a new DOS disklabel with disk identifier 0x6784fc4b.
Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
After that, of course, the previous content won't be recoverable.

Warning: invalid flag 0x0000 of partition table 4 will be corrected by w(rite)

Command (m for help): w
The partition table has been altered!

Calling ioctl() to re-read partition table.
Syncing disks.


I have other USB hard drives with 320GB and they really mount fine. 


Is this a limitation of RPi? Or a problem with this specific Hard Drive?   
How can I use this large disk with my RPi? 


update: solved the issue with help of the commentators here...

here is what I did ...


I thought I have some weired issue with Debian Wheezy &amp; gparted. So, I reformatted the hard drive to NTFS. Before that I ERASED the partition table. 
And created a new single NTFS partition. 
Bingo! RPi, identified the partition. However, it claimed my Drive is now 2TB big, and recommended I will use GPT:

root@raspberrypi:/home/ozn# fdisk -l /dev/sda

Disk /dev/sda: 2199.0 GB, 2199023255552 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 267349 cylinders, total 4294967296 sectors

I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes

Disk /dev/sda doesn't contain a valid partition table
root@raspberrypi:/home/ozn# fdisk  /dev/sda
Device contains neither a valid DOS partition table, nor Sun, SGI or OSF disklabel
Building a new DOS disklabel with disk identifier 0xb7032c3f.
Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
After that, of course, the previous content won't be recoverable.

partition table format (GPT).



whoops! That is WRONG!

So, I disconnected the hard drive again. re-connented it to my laptop. I erased the partition table again, and re-created the partition table using fdisk on RPi! not on my laptop! This time, I took a short cut, and created the disk partition with ext4 directly. 
    I plugged the hard-drive to RPi and BINGO!

conclusion (?)

My guess is that gparted in Debian Wheezy includes some nasty bug which is sometimes showing it's ugly face. I would report a bug if I had more solid evidence. But ... since I have only one 500GB hard drive, and I don't want to
risk the health of this hard drive reformatting it so many time, I will settle this with it. If you happen to bump into this post, and you have had similar problems with large SATA drives and partitioning on wheezy, I would be happy to know.
","Basically instead of fdisk -l, you should use parted -l (install parted if you do not have it installed) to see the actual data partition and then mount the actual data partition (/dev/sdb2, etc) directly.

I wrote a short tutorial on how to do this:

http://www.zayblog.com/computer-and-it/2013/07/22/mounting-gpt-partitions-on-raspberry-pi/

I was able to mount 2 8TB partitions directly, without wiping the data/reformat the drive.

History

In 1647 Matthew Hopkins wrote The Discovery of Witches which were introduced as ""Certain Queries answered"" and had the form of a list of Question and Answer, even if the topic is inappropriate by today’s standards. The label FAQ origins from the early 1980s mailing lists where NASA hoped to get new users read the old mail conversations, which were not the case. Instead the same questions were answered again and again and the need for FAQ was born. The acronym FAQ was invented by Eugene Miya and FAQ were later used in mail on a weekly basis at first and later on as a daily mail.


  Today FAQ is more frequently used to refer to the list, and a text consisting of questions and their answers is often called an FAQ regardless of whether the questions are actually frequently asked, if they are asked at all.[1]


Problem

Acronyms are generally bad, since it excludes those who do not know the meaning. They either have to search for the acronym, if they are interested, or just ignore it. If a label is ignored, there is not much use of it and an entire section of valid content is lost by bad labeling. However, it is a very strong web convention which might lead to confusion over time for experienced users.
Also the original meaning have changed (see quote), which also implies that the label would be wrong.

Isn’t the FAQ label obsolete by now? and if so How do we relabel it to suit both experienced and new users?

Example

Say I have this file:

$ ls -l | grep bbbb
-rw-rw-r--   1 saml saml    3283 May 18 02:49 bbbb


Now I run your script, I called it df.bash. The df command is already taken in Unix:

$ ./df.bash bbbb 
Size of bbbb -- 3283 bytes, 386 words, 94 lines.


Look for a file that doesn't exist:

$ ./df.bash bbbbbbb
$ 


Alternative method

You can save some wasted calls by consolidating and having awk do the counting instead of wc.

#!/bin/bash

FILENAME=$1

[ -f ""$FILENAME"" ] || exit

FILEBYTES=$(stat -c%s ""$FILENAME"")
FILEWORDS=$(awk '{ total = total + NF }; END {print total}' ""$FILENAME"")
FILELINES=$(awk 'END {print NR}' ""$FILENAME"")

printf ""Size of %s -- %s bytes, %s words, %s lines.\n"" \
        ""$FILENAME"" ""$FILEBYTES"" ""$FILEWORDS"" ""$FILELINES""

I think the custom power/exponent methods are a probably waste of time when Math.pow and Math.exp would do just as well in this context.
The X/Y passes can be identical except the direction the bell curve is applied in. I'm assuming the extra passes are to handle the edges, but I think you might come out ahead by just doing 2 passes and perform clipping as you go.
I think I see some bit-hacking tricks to avoid some divides after going through the inner multiplication loops. I'm not convinced that doing this and going through all the averaging stuff is going to be faster than just doing two simple passes using multiples in the inner loop and 3 integer divides when the loop is complete.
Some multiplies can also be eliminated when writing to the temp array by making another array containing the offsets for each row. Like this:

temp = new int[w * h];  
row = new int[h];

// make row offsets  
for(int i = 0; i &lt; h; i++)  
    row[i] = w * i;  

// write a pixel  
temp[x + row[y]] = color;  

// read a pixel  
color = temp[x + row[y]];  

Try to avoid calling methods within the X loops, they probably have a bigger overhead than you want for this.

I think the custom power/exponent methods are a probably waste of time when Math.pow and Math.exp would do just as well in this context.
The X/Y passes can be identical except the direction the bell curve is applied in. I'm assuming the extra passes are to handle the edges, but I think you might come out ahead by just doing 2 passes and perform clipping as you go.
I think I see some bit-hacking tricks to avoid some divides after going through the inner multiplication loops. I'm not convinced that doing this and going through all the averaging stuff is going to be faster than just doing two simple passes using multiples in the inner loop and 3 integer divides when the loop is complete.
Some multiplies can also be eliminated when writing to the temp array by making another array containing the offsets for each row. Like this:

temp = new int[w * h];  
row = new int[h];

// make row offsets  
for(int i = 0; i &lt; h; i++)  
    row[i] = w * i;  

// write a pixel  
temp[x + row[y]] = color;  

// read a pixel  
color = temp[x + row[y]];  

Try to avoid calling methods within the X loops, they probably have a bigger overhead than you want for this.

Innocent is not a digital company though - the point is that they invest a lot into the product quality.

Marketing is way more efficient (aka delivering better conversion rates) if the promise made in the marketing messages (usually: ""Our product is great"") is kept by the product itself. And many successful digital products distinguish themselfs by great UX.

I've seen products failing presumeably due to bad UX, even though great marketing efforts have been made. And I saw products failing that had great UX - some because of a mismatch in product-market-fit. Some failed because the world never got to know about the product, as a result of the absence of good marketing, PR etc. 

That said, I think a valuable product with a great user experience is the precondition for efficient marketing and makes the job of marketing much easier. The ROI of marketing activities for a good or great product is certainly higher than for bad products.

As Martin Brandenburg wrote in a comment, it is not clear whether $F_H$ and $F_O$ are functors at all. In fact, they fail to be functors, because $F(g\circ f)=F(g)\circ F(f)$ fails.

For $F_H$ look at
$\begin{matrix}

F_H(g) \circ F_H(f)\\

$\begin{matrix}

$\begin{matrix}
F_H(g \circ f)\\
\begin{matrix}
* &amp; \longrightarrow &amp; * \\
* &amp; {}^{\underline{\quad}\nearrow} &amp; *
\end{matrix}\end{matrix}$.
Hence $F_H(g) \circ F_H(f)$ and $F_H(g \circ f)$ are different.

Here, the vertical stars ""describe"" specific semilattices (commutative idempotent semigroups), where the result of a multiplication is the lower of the two involved stars (i.e. the meet or the greatest lower bound). Hence the identity element is given by the highest star in each case. The arrows ""describe"" specific homomorphisms.

For $F_O$ look at

Is there a polynomial $p(z)\in \mathbb{C}[x]$ with $deg(p)&gt;1$ with the following property?:

Every densely defined operator $A:D(A)\to D(A),\;D(A)\subset H$  with $p(A)=0$ is  necessarily  a  bounded operator on $H$.

That is the polynomial-operator equation $p(A)=0$ has only bounded solution.
",Ali Taghavi,https://mathoverflow.net/users/36688,"I do not think so.  

Observation: Without loss of generality, $p(x)$ can be taken to be monic (constant multiples won't affect either $p(A) = 0$ or boundedness).  

Case 1: $p$ is degree $2$.

By the above reduction, $p(x) = (x - \lambda)(x - \mu)$ for some $\lambda$ and $\mu$ in $\mathbb{C}$ (since $A$ clearly commutes with itself and with $I$, and since $A$ maps $D(A)$ to itself, this decomposition is reasonable).  Yet if $p(A) = 0$, take the operator $\displaystyle B = A - \frac{\lambda + \mu}{2} I$ (with the same domain), and we see that for $\displaystyle \nu = \frac{\lambda - \mu}{2}$, $B$ satisfies $(B + \nu)(B - \nu) = 0$, or $B^2 - \nu^2 = 0$.  We will show that an unbounded choice of $B$ exists, satisfying $B: D(B) \to D(B)$, hence an unbounded choice of $A$ exists, with $A: D(A) \to D(A)$.  

Subcase 1: $\nu = 0$.  Then take $H = \ell^2(\mathbb{N})$, let $H_0 = D(B)$ be the sequences with only finitely many nonzero elements, and let $B$ be the operator represented by the infinite matrix 

$$ \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; \cdots \\
                   0 &amp; 0 &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; \cdots \\
                     &amp;   &amp; 0 &amp; 2 &amp;   &amp;   &amp; \cdots \\
                     &amp;   &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp;   &amp;   &amp; \cdots \\
                     &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; 0 &amp; 3 &amp; \cdots \\
                     &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \ddots \\
        \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots \end{pmatrix},$$
which is clearly well-defined on $H_0$ and clearly maps $H_0$ to itself.  Then $B^2 = 0$, but letting $e_j$ be the $j$th basis vector, $B e_{2j} = j e_{2j - 1}$, so clearly $B$ is unbounded.

Subcase 2: $\nu \neq 0$.  Then again take $H = \ell^2(\mathbb{N})$, and $H_0$ the almost-everywhere-$0$ sequences.  We now define $B$ by the matrix 

$$ \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; \nu &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; \cdots \\
                   -\nu &amp; 0 &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; \cdots \\
                     &amp;   &amp; 0 &amp; 2\nu &amp;   &amp;   &amp; \cdots \\
                     &amp;   &amp; -\frac{1}{2}\nu &amp; 0 &amp;   &amp;   &amp; \cdots \\
                     &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; 0 &amp; 3\nu &amp; \cdots \\
                     &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; -\frac{1}{3}\nu &amp; 0 &amp; \ddots \\
        \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots \end{pmatrix}.$$

Again, $B$ maps $H_0$ to itself, and $B^2 e_j = \nu^2 e_j$ for all $j$, so $B^2 = \nu^2$ on $H_0$. Yet $Be_{2j} = j e_{2j - 1}$, so $B$ is unbounded.

Case 2: $\deg p &gt; 2$.

Well, then $p(x) = q_1(x) q_2(x)$, with $\deg q_1 = 2$, $\deg q_2 \geq 1$.  Again take $H$ and $H_0$ as above, and take $A$ to be an unbounded solution to $q_1(A) = 0$, satisfying $A: D(A) \to D(A)$.  Then $p(A) = q_1(A) q_2(A) = 0 q_2(A) = 0$, and $A$ is unbounded.  [Again, my naive factoring really depends on $D(A) \subseteq D(A^n)$, hence I am strongly using the $A: D(A) \to D(A)$ fact here.] QED.

Of course, Case 2 is sort of a cheat.  I think there should be a ""natural"" example in general, since you can construct unbounded examples to $A^n = 0$ by just increasing the order of the nilpotency, and $A^n = I$ by taking positive real numbers $a_1, \dotsc, a_n$ with $a_1 a_2 \dotsc a_n = 1$ and letting the building-block matrix be

$$ \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; a_1 &amp; &amp; &amp; \cdots  &amp; &amp; \\
                   &amp; 0 &amp; a_2 &amp; &amp; \cdots  &amp; &amp; \\
                   &amp; &amp; 0 &amp; a_3 &amp; \cdots  &amp; &amp; \\
              \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp;  \ddots &amp; \ddots  &amp; &amp;\\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp;  \vdots &amp; \ddots  &amp; \ddots  &amp; \\

a_n &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; &amp; \dotsc &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} $$
Then again make a block-diagonal infinite matrix such that as we repeat the blocks, $a_3, \dotsc, a_n$ are constant, and $a_1 \to \infty$ and $a_2 \to 0$ (or somesuch).

                   0 &amp; 0 &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; \cdots \\
                     &amp;   &amp; 0 &amp; 2 &amp;   &amp;   &amp; \cdots \\
                     &amp;   &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp;   &amp;   &amp; \cdots \\
                     &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; 0 &amp; 3 &amp; \cdots \\
                     &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \ddots \\
        \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots \end{pmatrix},$$
which is clearly well-defined on $H_0$ and clearly maps $H_0$ to itself.  Then $B^2 = 0$, but letting $e_j$ be the $j$th basis vector, $B e_{2j} = j e_{2j - 1}$, so clearly $B$ is unbounded.

Subcase 2: $\nu \neq 0$.  Then again take $H = \ell^2(\mathbb{N})$, and $H_0$ the almost-everywhere-$0$ sequences.  We now define $B$ by the matrix 

$$ \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; \nu &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; \cdots \\
                   -\nu &amp; 0 &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; \cdots \\
                     &amp;   &amp; 0 &amp; 2\nu &amp;   &amp;   &amp; \cdots \\
                     &amp;   &amp; -\frac{1}{2}\nu &amp; 0 &amp;   &amp;   &amp; \cdots \\
                     &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; 0 &amp; 3\nu &amp; \cdots \\
                     &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; -\frac{1}{3}\nu &amp; 0 &amp; \ddots \\
        \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots \end{pmatrix}.$$

Again, $B$ maps $H_0$ to itself, and $B^2 e_j = \nu^2 e_j$ for all $j$, so $B^2 = \nu^2$ on $H_0$. Yet $Be_{2j} = j e_{2j - 1}$, so $B$ is unbounded.

Case 2: $\deg p &gt; 2$.

Well, then $p(x) = q_1(x) q_2(x)$, with $\deg q_1 = 2$, $\deg q_2 \geq 1$.  Again take $H$ and $H_0$ as above, and take $A$ to be an unbounded solution to $q_1(A) = 0$, satisfying $A: D(A) \to D(A)$.  Then $p(A) = q_1(A) q_2(A) = 0 q_2(A) = 0$, and $A$ is unbounded.  [Again, my naive factoring really depends on $D(A) \subseteq D(A^n)$, hence I am strongly using the $A: D(A) \to D(A)$ fact here.] QED.

Of course, Case 2 is sort of a cheat.  I think there should be a ""natural"" example in general, since you can construct unbounded examples to $A^n = 0$ by just increasing the order of the nilpotency, and $A^n = I$ by taking positive real numbers $a_1, \dotsc, a_n$ with $a_1 a_2 \dotsc a_n = 1$ and letting the building-block matrix be

$$ \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; a_1 &amp; &amp; &amp; \cdots  &amp; &amp; \\
                   &amp; 0 &amp; a_2 &amp; &amp; \cdots  &amp; &amp; \\
                   &amp; &amp; 0 &amp; a_3 &amp; \cdots  &amp; &amp; \\
              \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp;  \ddots &amp; \ddots  &amp; &amp;\\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp;  \vdots &amp; \ddots  &amp; \ddots  &amp; \\
   &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;  0 &amp; a_{n-1} \\
a_n &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; &amp; \dotsc &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} $$
Then again make a block-diagonal infinite matrix such that as we repeat the blocks, $a_3, \dotsc, a_n$ are constant, and $a_1 \to \infty$ and $a_2 \to 0$ (or somesuch).

",vemv,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/24071,"Branching always begins with fear that merging will break things or leave unnoticed bugs for long. 

However, it is the most essential element for a reasonably sized product or project. Here are the few distinct categories where branches are a must - 
they are :  

1. Branch post release
This is done to maintain post release patches. these patches are essential to support current versions in the market till next major releases are still not ready. 

2. Branch per Task or component 
Here a few independent groups are given the branch that they keep check-in while rest of the team (or other branches) doesn't have to accept any work till entire new functionality or project is completely finished and merged to trunk.

3. Branching for special customer support
Here a few branches are created to support only for a specific (set) of customers. 

Branching and merging begins with some fear always, but in my experience, as people begin to put disciplined code, it becomes indispensable for any large development.

To date I've not used branching/merges in production code, now I decided to give it a try in a small team environment.

I'm afraid of suffering the same pain as the described in Spolsky's article. Is there a ""right"" way of working with branches in svn?
","Branching always begins with fear that merging will break things or leave unnoticed bugs for long. 

However, it is the most essential element for a reasonably sized product or project. Here are the few distinct categories where branches are a must - 
they are :  

1. Branch post release
This is done to maintain post release patches. these patches are essential to support current versions in the market till next major releases are still not ready. 

2. Branch per Task or component 
Here a few independent groups are given the branch that they keep check-in while rest of the team (or other branches) doesn't have to accept any work till entire new functionality or project is completely finished and merged to trunk.

3. Branching for special customer support
Here a few branches are created to support only for a specific (set) of customers. 

Branching and merging begins with some fear always, but in my experience, as people begin to put disciplined code, it becomes indispensable for any large development.

5844,5844,9261,Isn’t the FAQ label obsolete by now?,"Don’t get me wrong in the beginning of reading this. I really mean the label and not the content of FAQ. The content is very useful if its’ made the right way (as here on ux.se), but there are plenty of examples where it isn’t. The real question concerns the label which is a convention I’d like to challenge.

History

In 1647 Matthew Hopkins wrote The Discovery of Witches which were introduced as ""Certain Queries answered"" and had the form of a list of Question and Answer, even if the topic is inappropriate by today’s standards. The label FAQ origins from the early 1980s mailing lists where NASA hoped to get new users read the old mail conversations, which were not the case. Instead the same questions were answered again and again and the need for FAQ was born. The acronym FAQ was invented by Eugene Miya and FAQ were later used in mail on a weekly basis at first and later on as a daily mail.


  Today FAQ is more frequently used to refer to the list, and a text consisting of questions and their answers is often called an FAQ regardless of whether the questions are actually frequently asked, if they are asked at all.[1]


Problem

Acronyms are generally bad, since it excludes those who do not know the meaning. They either have to search for the acronym, if they are interested, or just ignore it. If a label is ignored, there is not much use of it and an entire section of valid content is lost by bad labeling. However, it is a very strong web convention which might lead to confusion over time for experienced users.
Also the original meaning have changed (see quote), which also implies that the label would be wrong.

Question

Isn’t the FAQ label obsolete by now? and if so How do we relabel it to suit both experienced and new users?



Edit: I’d really like to know why we can or cannot change the label FAQ. Current answer does not meet that criterion.

It is still and will likely remain the most intuitive label for sections of ""frequently asked questions"" or similar secondary information.



When not to use FAQ

I do believe there are plenty of times where ""FAQ"" isn't the right label. I think it boils down to the question of if the term you are considering as an alternative is REALLY more intuitive than FAQ. Does it describe the section better? Would the user be able to navigate there intuitively?

570,570,894,"The hobbit, how is it possible that 48 FPS is better than 24 FPS","I have a question about the movie the hobbit. People claim that the quality of the movie is way better because the movie is recorded and displayed in 48 fps. Normally this is 24 fps.

My opinion is that better frame quality only is possible with better techniques or when other settings are used. I think it can’t be because of only a frame increasement. It’s true that more frames per second makes new techniques available.

But why do they think that the screen quality is better? Is it maybe because of a higher resolution? Or do they just use other settings?
",Laurence,https://movies.stackexchange.com/users/3733,"There is a huge difference in the feeling of the film based upon the Frames Per Second it was shot in.

There are a number of films that were shot using a digital camera, but at a higher 30FPS that were reviewed to have a ""poor quality or feel"" because the faster shutter rate gave it a television feeling.

Many professional digital camera now shoot at the slower 24FPS to capture that film feeling.

Many faster 30FPS digital cameras often produced a cleaner, sharper, wider range of color image that was perceived to be to different from traditional film stock. That the color space and feel of film could not be reproduced digitally. Much of this is true.

Today, many digital cameras now use all the same lens, hardware and mounts that older traditional film cameras used. The sensors are much more refined and adjusted to give a more natural color space. Post-processing has also greatly improved to reproduce many film stocks as a digital filter.

If you were speaking to someone who was not technical, but experienced in the film industry. He may have experienced producing films at 30FPS which were much sharper and cleaner then traditional 24FPS film stock. As a result. I can totally understand his perspective that 30FPS has a higher quality image.

People claim that the quality of the movie is way better because the movie is recorded and displayed in 48 fps. Normally this is 24 fps.

My opinion is that better frame quality only is possible with better techniques or when other settings are used. I think it can’t be because of only a frame increasement. It’s true that more frames per second makes new techniques available.

But why do they think that the screen quality is better? Is it maybe because of a higher resolution? Or do they just use other settings?
","There is a huge difference in the feeling of the film based upon the Frames Per Second it was shot in.

There are a number of films that were shot using a digital camera, but at a higher 30FPS that were reviewed to have a ""poor quality or feel"" because the faster shutter rate gave it a television feeling.

Many professional digital camera now shoot at the slower 24FPS to capture that film feeling.

Many faster 30FPS digital cameras often produced a cleaner, sharper, wider range of color image that was perceived to be to different from traditional film stock. That the color space and feel of film could not be reproduced digitally. Much of this is true.

Today, many digital cameras now use all the same lens, hardware and mounts that older traditional film cameras used. The sensors are much more refined and adjusted to give a more natural color space. Post-processing has also greatly improved to reproduce many film stocks as a digital filter.

If you were speaking to someone who was not technical, but experienced in the film industry. He may have experienced producing films at 30FPS which were much sharper and cleaner then traditional 24FPS film stock. As a result. I can totally understand his perspective that 30FPS has a higher quality image.

The techniques to produce 30FPS and 24FPS films at one time was very different. Today, it's better to clarify that the difference is not frame rate, but film versus digital.

Additionally, frames per second can have a direct impact on the type of motion blur produced in an image. The higher the frame rate the less motion blur there is. Resulting in a cleaner sharper image for objects in motion.

In fact, every known attack on an RSA signature scheme is either of the above kind (with more or less involved computations to exhibit $m_i$, $u_i$, $r$, $s$); or amounts to factorization of $n$ (which includes anything recovering $d$, perhaps by side-channel attack); or is some implementation error, perhaps widespread.

3479,3479,5548,Why do objects fall at the same acceleration?,"I read these two posts and now I am more confused.

Do heavier objects fall faster?

Don&#39;t heavier objects actually fall faster because they exert their own gravity?

I was going to ask: if mass is an objects tendency to resist acceleration then why do two objects of different masses fall to the Earth at the same acceleration?

Then I read those posts and it seems that even though it is very small, the more massive object falls faster. Okay I understand, both objects attract each other.

If two cars of different masses collide doesn't the car with less mass accelerate more even though both cars received the same Force. Then that implies you need more force to accelerate a large mass than to accelerate a small mass. Because that is how I see it, the Moon attracts the Earth with the same Force as the Earth attracts the Moon but the Earth accelerates less due to its larger mass.

So then how is mass an object's tendency to resist acceleration? I am aware of $F_1 = F_2 = GMm/r^2$. So should we not really be able to see the difference in acceleration when dropping a massive object?
",CharlieK,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/43959,"
  Mass is an object's tendency to resist acceleration.


This applies when both masses you're testing are subjected to identical forces. 

From Newton's Law of Gravity,

$$F = G \frac{M \cdot m}{r^2}$$

It is fairly obvious that the force the Earth exerts on a heavy body is more that what it exerts on a light body, so you can not compare the accelerations by comparing just the masses in this case.

Newton's second law gives $$a = \frac{F}{m} = G \frac{M}{r^2}$$

For two bodies an equal distance away from the Earth's center of mass, you can see that the acceleration for both bodies is indeed, the same and independent of the body mass.

Of course, this assumes there is no drag on the falling body, and that the only appreciable force is that due to Newton's Law.

To summarize: 

There is no difference in the acceleration of two objects of identical shape but different masses. The difference you observe between a feather and a golf ball, for example, is not because of gravity - it's because of the shape and the air resistance the body encounters.

Clarification This answer assumes you're in an inertial reference frame (attached to the center of mass of the falling object and the Earth), and that ""falling"" means the motion of the object towards this center of mass. 

If you consider falling to mean the motion of the object relative to the Earth, then, because the force exerted on the Earth by a heavier body is more, the Earth will accelerate towards the center of mass ever so slightly, and therefore the object will fall ever so slightly faster.

Do heavier objects fall faster?

Don&#39;t heavier objects actually fall faster because they exert their own gravity?

I was going to ask: if mass is an objects tendency to resist acceleration then why do two objects of different masses fall to the Earth at the same acceleration?

Then I read those posts and it seems that even though it is very small, the more massive object falls faster. Okay I understand, both objects attract each other.

If two cars of different masses collide doesn't the car with less mass accelerate more even though both cars received the same Force. Then that implies you need more force to accelerate a large mass than to accelerate a small mass. Because that is how I see it, the Moon attracts the Earth with the same Force as the Earth attracts the Moon but the Earth accelerates less due to its larger mass.

So then how is mass an object's tendency to resist acceleration? I am aware of $F_1 = F_2 = GMm/r^2$. So should we not really be able to see the difference in acceleration when dropping a massive object?
","
  Mass is an object's tendency to resist acceleration.


This applies when both masses you're testing are subjected to identical forces. 

From Newton's Law of Gravity,

$$F = G \frac{M \cdot m}{r^2}$$

It is fairly obvious that the force the Earth exerts on a heavy body is more that what it exerts on a light body, so you can not compare the accelerations by comparing just the masses in this case.

Newton's second law gives $$a = \frac{F}{m} = G \frac{M}{r^2}$$

For two bodies an equal distance away from the Earth's center of mass, you can see that the acceleration for both bodies is indeed, the same and independent of the body mass.

Of course, this assumes there is no drag on the falling body, and that the only appreciable force is that due to Newton's Law.

To summarize: 

There is no difference in the acceleration of two objects of identical shape but different masses. The difference you observe between a feather and a golf ball, for example, is not because of gravity - it's because of the shape and the air resistance the body encounters.

Clarification This answer assumes you're in an inertial reference frame (attached to the center of mass of the falling object and the Earth), and that ""falling"" means the motion of the object towards this center of mass. 

If you consider falling to mean the motion of the object relative to the Earth, then, because the force exerted on the Earth by a heavier body is more, the Earth will accelerate towards the center of mass ever so slightly, and therefore the object will fall ever so slightly faster.

A reader who is familiar with the Modern sense of the word but unaware of this nunance in the Biblical sense could miss important meaning in the text, as in Ruth 1:1: ""&rlm;... &rlm;וַיֵּלֶךְ אִישׁ מִבֵּ֧ית לֶ֣חֶם  יְהוּדָה לָגוּר בִּשְׂדֵי מוֹאָב&rlm; ...&rlm;"" - ""... And a certain man of Beth-lehem in Judah went to sojourn in the field of Moab ..."" If this verb is read as ""to dwell,"" then the reader misinterprets the subject's intended temporary evacuation as an intended permanent relocation.1 Thus, the dramatic change of intent hinted in the next verse's ""&rlm;... &rlm;וַיִּֽהְיוּ־שָֽׁם"" - ""... and they continued there,"" is also lost.


I don't know if any comprehensive dictionaries of Biblical Hebrew, consistent with Jewish tradition, exist. To be fully accurate, such a dictionary would have to deal explicitly with the fact that the same word can have different meanings in different contexts, depending on the time period the book came from as well as the actual context.

Not the same as a dictionary, but one way to read Tanach in English translation, consistent with Jewish tradition, would be to use a complete Jewish translation of Tanach. One well-regarded trandition-adherent version is that of Judaica Press, which is available in convenient form online on Chabad's website.

5934,5934,9403,When can an article be omitted?,"I am aware that articles are the modifiers, which introduce a noun/noun_phrase in a sentence, and by the rules of English grammar we should use an article before referring to a noun in a sentence.

However, I see that the above rule is not strictly followed. I have seen sentences where though a noun/noun_phrase is used in a sentence but an introductory article is not used.

Eg : Login to desktop and start the paint application [ Desktop is a noun, hence I expect either ""Login to a desktop and ...."" or ""Login to the desktop at the corner and .....""]

So please help me understand, when can an article be omitted ?
Thanks in advance.
",Flair,https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/8260,"There are various special cases, but in general: You need an article in English whenever you have a singular noun that is not a proper name. You do not use an article with a proper name. Articles are optional with plurals -- not in the sense that you can include them or not on a whim, but that they change the meaning. You should also not use an article when you use a possessive, like ""my"", or the adjective ""one"". (I'm sure I've seen other adjectives that take the place of an article, but I can't think of any right now.)

Maybe that's not entirely clear, so here are some examples:

""You can start the application."" ""Application"" is singular, so an article is required.

""You can start applications."" ""Applications"" is plural, so you don't need an article.

""You can start Microsoft Word."" ""Microsoft Word"" is a proper noun, the name of one particular application, so no article is used.

""You can start one application."" ""One"" takes the place of an article.

""You  can start his application."" ""His"" is a possessive that makes an article unneeded.

If you use ""the"" before a plural, it indicates that you are talking about some particular set. Like if you said, ""You can start applications"", that would mean any applications, but if you said, ""You  can start the applications"", that would indicate that you are talking about some specific set of applications, not any applications in the world.

In your example, I would have written ""You can log in to THE desktop"". ""Desktop"" is not a proper noun and so requires an article. Or perhaps in this case the writer is referring to some specific product called ""Desktop"" and so he is thinking of it as a proper noun. If that's the case, it should be capitalized.

Recently I tried a new place that had (what they called) ""Hibachi"", which looked very similar, and I originally mistook for 'the same'. When I inquired about the Mongolian grill I was informed that there is a difference.

Can someone clarify for me what the differences are?
",Cos Callis,https://cooking.stackexchange.com/users/6279,"I know this is an old post but I'd like to add something that I was told by the owner of a Mongolian resturant. He told me the origin of what is now called Mongolian BBQ was the cooking methods of the Mongolian soldiers (read: Genghis Khan's army) who fought and traveled for long periods. They would communally gather food - meats, fish, vegatables, etc., and then individually cook their own meals in their helmets, over an open campfire. They carried oils and sauces along with them and they were considered prized possessions.

I can easily imagine this to be true and that this tradition would evolve into a family practice in a home, in a larger ""wok"" device, and eventully into a resturant setting. Somewhere along the line, the wok was inverted to make the cooking of multiple meals possible.

As the host continued to talk about these differences, I was concerned that the subtleties were ""lost in translation"".","I know this is an old post, but I want to add that I was told by the owner of a Mongolian restaurant. He told me that the origin of the so-called Mongolian barbecue is the cooking method of Mongolian soldiers (read: Genghis Khan's Army) who have been fighting and travelling for a long time. They will collect food together - meat, fish, vegetables, etc. and then cook on their own with helmets on the campfire. They carry oil and condiments with them and are considered valuable property."

",Caius Eugene,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/23581,"You may be confusing some details. A height map is simply a 2D array of data. Each point represents 3 pieces of information: an x and y location and a number to represent the height at that point. For a simpler example, lets look at a 1D array of data that creates some 2D terrain. Each data point here will contain an x location and a number to represent the height at that point:



Pretty simple right? It's just a regular old graph. As you can see, the numbers on the x axis go up by tens. We could easily change that to go up by 100's or by .01's. Same goes for the data displayed on the y axis. We can scale those values however we like.

Basically, it's just numbers until you decide how you're going to visually represent it. So, saying a height map of 64px by 64px is already one step beyond where we need to go. Since a grayscale image is just another way to display the same data as a 3D height map. The data to represent each is coming from the same place.



Further, you don't even need a 1 to 1 relationship between data and display. You could have far more vertices than you have data points, or far fewer. They don't even need to be equally spaced.

For the most basic example: Yes, generate an array of [64][64] data points to make a grayscale image or a 3D heightmap. Each [x][y] of your array will correspond to the x, y of your vertices and the value stored in each [x][y] will represent the z value of your vertex.

The page that manages the login will get the users facebook id and then look on the ASP.NET membership tables for a pre-existing user that has a matching ID.

No match: a new user is created and logged in (no problem).

A match:  I want to log the user on.  The problem is that I have the hashed password and I cannot use MembershipService.ValidateUser(logOn.UserName, logOn.Password) to log the user on.

If I just use FormsAuthentication.SetAuthCookie, the user doesn't appear as logged in.

I could set enablePasswordRetrieval to true in the web config and then just get the actual password, but I don't want to.  I want this to be secure.

Does anyone know a way to log a user onto ASP.NET Membership just using the user name?  I have looked at the MembershipProvider class for alternative methods but I cant find any.

Thanks,

","You could try FormsAuthentication.RedirectFromLoginPage (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ka5ffkce.aspx), which sets the cookie (I believe,though you may have to manually set the cookie), and then redirect to the designated page to redirect from (specified in the configuration file for the  auth settings).

Now convert the month name to a natural number, and there you have your answer. What’s today’s date?  It’s May 24th.  Instead of writing May-24, we simply change the “May” to “5” and write 5-24 or ⁵⁄₂₄.  

That way it follows the natural language order and so requires no mental gymnastics to switch things around when speaking the date aloud.  Similarly “September 11th” gets written ⁹⁄₁₁, etc.

This isn’t usually any sort of problem because of universal consensus on how to interpret such things in the United States.  If you write day/month/year in America, you will not be understood.  Although I myself prefer the ISO notation, normal people do not use it in their daily affairs.

or any other (balanced) token list between the braces; since this is about gathering tokens, you can be sure there is no attempt to expand anything there. Unlike macros, token list registers do no spontaneously expand to the tokens they hold (if TeX encounters the name of a token list register when expecting an action, it will assume this starts an assignment to the register, and protest if no opening brace follows), so to get at the contents, you must explicitly expand with \the. Hence if at the end of the day you want to transfer the tokens to become the body of a macro, you can say

\edef\macro{\the\MyList}


(the \edef is used because the contents of \MyList is wanted here and now, not later when \macro gets expanded). Note that even though \edef usually keeps expanding as far as it can, the result of \the applied to a token list register is explicitly excluded from any further expansion attempts, so you can be sure that \macro will expand to exactly the tokens that were collected in \MyList.

Now to extend to contents of a token list register is fairly simple; you must just ensure the the old contents gets to be expanded into the new token list before the assignment is made. For this a single \expandafter will do:

\MyList=\expandafter{\the\Mylist more tokens here}


When you need to expand something towards the end of the token list, it takes a bit more effort. Say you want to append to the contents of \MyList that of another token list register \AnotherList. Then you could ensure that the rightmost list gets expanded, and then the leftmost one (can you see why this order is necessary?), all this before the assignment takes place, by a whole slough of \expandafters:

\let\x=\expandafter
\MyList=\x\x\x{\x\the\x\MyList\the\AnotherList}


However there is  an easier way, that mixes the expansive nature of \edef and the passive nature of token lists to get detailed control over expansion. It needs an auxiliary macro, say \temp:

I final remark about the question; you suggest that \let serves to copy the expansion of one macro to another macro without further expanding that expansion
(as using \edef would do). While \let can be used for that, this is not its main purpose, and in fact this is just a corollary of what \let does in general: transfer the current meaning of one token to another one (provided the latter can have its meaning modified, so it should not be a non-active character). This is not limited to macros: you can make a control sequence stand for a plain character, or for a TeX primitive (as I did above to let \x stand for the primitive \expandafer; note that having instead \x expand to \expandafer would be quite different and quite useless) or for other meanings that a token can have. Just as an example of the last possibility, saying

\let\newname=\MyList


would transfer the current meaning (not the contents!) of \MyList to \newname. Since \MyList stood for an internal token list register of TeX, this makes \newname stand for the same register: it becomes an alias for \MyList, and assigning to one of them changes the contents of the other as well.

793,793,1259,System for Setting: Misfits,"On the recommendation of one of my players, I'm watching Misfits, a British TV show about kids (Their ages aren't so far specifically stated; they're old enough to drink and young enough to live at home, so late-teens to early 20s, I guess) serving community-service sentences who get super powers. The recommendation included an explicit desire for me to run a game like this.

I'm watching it and thinking about what system to run it in. I want to ask this question more clearly than my last system-for-setting question, so here are some specific points to consider when answering:

WARNING! Spoilers Below!

If you haven't watched the series but plan to, you might not want to read what follows. I tried to separate setting spoilers from the system requirements, but it just didn't work.


The world is gritty and the power level is relatively low. It reminded me of Wild Cards, with ""the storm"" as the catalyzing event. Therefore, the system must support fine gradations in power - the scale is pretty low, so a small advantage needs to be representable.
Powers are uncontrollable - at least at first. Alisha's lust-inspiring power is uncontrolled as far as I have watched, and the immortality power (obviously) works without conscious effort. Curtis' time rewind is a power of huge significance, but it's not controlled by the beginning of the second season either. Therefore the system must support uncontrolled and unreliable powers.

The recommendation included an explicit desire for me to run a game like this.

I'm watching it and thinking about what system to run it in. I want to ask this question more clearly than my last system-for-setting question, so here are some specific points to consider when answering:

WARNING! Spoilers Below!

If you haven't watched the series but plan to, you might not want to read what follows. I tried to separate setting spoilers from the system requirements, but it just didn't work.


The world is gritty and the power level is relatively low. It reminded me of Wild Cards, with ""the storm"" as the catalyzing event. Therefore, the system must support fine gradations in power - the scale is pretty low, so a small advantage needs to be representable.
Powers are uncontrollable - at least at first. Alisha's lust-inspiring power is uncontrolled as far as I have watched, and the immortality power (obviously) works without conscious effort. Curtis' time rewind is a power of huge significance, but it's not controlled by the beginning of the second season either. Therefore the system must support uncontrolled and unreliable powers.
The system you recommend must support regular humans as significant combat threats - Sally gave Simon a real fight. Player character death must be a real possibility.

2491,2491,3972,"What role is a ""Heavy"" supposed to fill?","Based on the name and my understanding of the TF2 class, a Heavy is a front-lines tanky soldier guy. But that doesn't really seem to be his role in XCOM. Assault soldiers are better at being in the front lines with their mobility and defensive abilities.

What, then, is the heavy supposed to be doing on the battlefield? What are the general strategies that are useful for heavy soldiers?
",StrixVaria,https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/1719,"Hello just reading through all the above and realized that my play style is quite different from most people that have answered this question. Heavies are by far what I call as close as possible to the X-COM the original in the fight against the giant single eye @ Cydonia: You had an inventory grid and I would just cram the soldier with heavy plasma on 1 hand with extra clips, psi amp on the other hand, blaster launcher in back pack, 1st blaster ammo in the back pack, 2nd &amp; 3rd bomb ammo in the belt, an electro flair, and the rest with as many alien grenades and proximity grenades, and the flying suit.

So to mimic the original X-COM I built my heavy with the following skills:
shredder rocket and 1 more rocket giving it a total of 3 blaster bombs.
I gave the heavy grenadier for 2 alien grenades, if only there were prox grenades.
Bullet swarm to mimic auto shot, and rapid reaction - kinda like saving time units for snap shot and just sit in the corners waiting for aliens at the base.

I debated between psi suit vs. archangel suit vs. titan vs. ghost for psi ready soldiers and after some playing around, in the end I went for ghost suit. Ghost suit is just too good as you run as far as u can without triggering the enemy to move, and on the next turn I'd have so many opening moves to choose from: bullet swarm or mind control for single enemies when they are close by, grenade if their clustered but too close to friendlies, or blaster if i can hit a lot without hurting friendlies. 

This was so good I decided to have 4 heavies like this. All 3 heavies go cloak, run in and surprise fireworks. Now the good thing about running into the enemies with ghosted heavies is that you can mind control them and before the control wears off group them up and grenade/blaster bomb em to death or even use their own grenades on em while clustered. So my heavies are the front of the line. I usually go with 4, followed by 2 medics for health patch up. In the end game, it was mandatory to have one of my heavy's go with psi suit as a volunteer, but now I know it's not needed to have the highest will power soldier to finish the game.

4879,4879,7768,Non Removable Presta Extension,"Just got a pair of tubular Vittoria Rally road tyres. They look perfect but the problem is that the valve is 42mm which is no good for my new awesome 50mm rims. Above all the valve core is not removable so the extenders I've got with them are useless.

The question is if there's any mean to extend the valves up to 60-80mm in this situation or should I return it back to the shop?

Thank you in advance for your advised.
",LoomyBear,https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/users/6459,"I also would recommend finding tubes with valves of the correct length. However, if that fails, I've had success using a presta to schrader adapter.  Often with shorter valves, there won't be enough room to attach a pump head, but there will be enough to attach an adapter, which you can then use a pump that works with schrader valves. Most pumps have the ability to do both now. I'm not sure if this will work in your situation, since you say you have 50mm rims and 42mm valves which to me would mean that there would be no part of the valve protruding from the rim.

However, if it fails, I have successfully used the Presta to Schrader adapter. In general, for shorter valves, there is not enough space to connect the pump head, but there is enough space to connect the adapter, and then a pump that works with the Schrader Valve can be used.

1922,1922,3059,Isn’t the FAQ label obsolete by now?,"Don’t get me wrong in the beginning of reading this. I really mean the label and not the content of FAQ. The content is very useful if its’ made the right way (as here on ux.se), but there are plenty of examples where it isn’t. The real question concerns the label which is a convention I’d like to challenge.

History

In 1647 Matthew Hopkins wrote The Discovery of Witches which were introduced as ""Certain Queries answered"" and had the form of a list of Question and Answer, even if the topic is inappropriate by today’s standards. The label FAQ origins from the early 1980s mailing lists where NASA hoped to get new users read the old mail conversations, which were not the case. Instead the same questions were answered again and again and the need for FAQ was born. The acronym FAQ was invented by Eugene Miya and FAQ were later used in mail on a weekly basis at first and later on as a daily mail.


  Today FAQ is more frequently used to refer to the list, and a text consisting of questions and their answers is often called an FAQ regardless of whether the questions are actually frequently asked, if they are asked at all.[1]


Problem

Acronyms are generally bad, since it excludes those who do not know the meaning. They either have to search for the acronym, if they are interested, or just ignore it. If a label is ignored, there is not much use of it and an entire section of valid content is lost by bad labeling. However, it is a very strong web convention which might lead to confusion over time for experienced users.
Also the original meaning have changed (see quote), which also implies that the label would be wrong.

Question

Isn’t the FAQ label obsolete by now? and if so How do we relabel it to suit both experienced and new users?

4828,4828,7675,why wavelet is more suitable for image compression compared to DCT?,"Everyone knows that JPEG2000 can obtain much better compression result than JPEG. The fundamental transform behind JPEG2000 is wavelet while the basic transform in JPEG is DCT. So my question is why wavelet is more suitable for image compression compared to DCT. Thanks. 
",feelfree,https://dsp.stackexchange.com/users/1674,"Both JPEG and JPEG 2000 use the change of basis compression type.

Namely, we transform the data into a different representation assuming in this representation the number of parameters needed to describe to data is lower.
Or to the least, most of the information is gathered within few parameters.

Now, if you look at the energy level of the DCT coefficients of real world images you'd see most of the energy is limited to the very few coefficients.
This is what JPG does, keeps only the few dominant coefficients and throws the rest.

How efficient is DCT?
It depends on how less coefficients are needed to describe the image in an acceptable quality.

It turns out that for Wavelets the situation is better.
Namely on real world images less coefficients are needed to describe the image with the same perceived quality.

This property is called the ability to decorrelate the data / being energy densed, etc...

At the end, it is all up to how much less parameters are needed to describe the same data.

P.S.
Using SVD / KLT (They are equivalent in this sense) would be even more efficient in the sense of how much less coefficients are needed for the same quality (In the $ {\ell}_{2} $ sense).
The problem is those bases are adaptive to the data and hence if you use them you have to include them to be able to decompress the data.

Any help is greatly appreciated. Here goes then:

Let M be a n-D manifold and $\dot x=F(x)u_1, F\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times m}, x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}, u_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$ be a control system evolving on M (F is the system matrix i.e. state transition function, and $u_1$ is the input of the system. For all practical purposes $u_1$ is an m-vector from an input space $\mathbb{R}^{m}$). Now let $x=\Psi (y)$ be a coordinate change on M and $u_2=M(y)u_1$ a transformation of the input $u_1$ of the first system. By applying these maps on the system, you get the new equations  $\dot y=F(y)u_2$. As you may notice, F is the same in both systems. The problem is why is this happening i.e. for what systems and transformations does this property hold?

A little more elaboration

It is useful to investigate the maps more closely. In the general case one has

$\dot x=D\Psi \dot y$
$\dot x= F(x)u_1$

thus
$\dot y=D\Psi ^{-1} F(x)u_1$, (1)

where $D\Psi$ is the Jacobian matrix of $\Psi$. In our case it actually turns out that:  

$\dot y=F(y)M(y)u_1$. (2)

You can then consider that $u_2=M(y)u_1$ and get the final system,

$\dot y=F(y)u_2$,

that is, the same system.
 By (1),(2) you get,

$D\Psi ^{-1} F(x)u_1=F(y)M(y)u_1 \Rightarrow (D\Psi ^{-1} F(x)-F(y)M(y))u_1=0$. 

Since this holds for every $u_1$, you have the condition,

$F(\Psi (y))=D\Psi F(y)M(y)$

So, what does this condition imply? What systems F and maps $\Psi$ hold this property (of system invariance)? I should note that F is nonlinear and a case study where this actually happens is the kinematic model of a unicycle robot i.e. this. Any ideas?
",Jorge,https://mathoverflow.net/users/19928,"This is not a surprising fact for driftless systems to have symmetries. In our previous work we considered only nonlinear systems with drift and classified the symmetries accordingly. In case of a driftless system
\dot x=F(x)u you can interpret $F$ (that's what it is) as a distribution of vector fields $f_1, \dots, f_m$ (column vectors of the matrix) and whenever such distribution is involutive ($[f_i, f_j]=\lambda_1(x)f_1+\cdots+\lambda_m(x)f_m$ then necessarily the system admits nontrivial symmetries (this is due to the Frobenius Theorem). That's the case you have here with the unicycle with $f_1=(\cos \theta, \sin \theta, 0), f_2=(0,0, 1)$. I can write in more extensive way but I hope you would get the idea from there.

For all practical purposes $u_1$ is an m-vector from an input space $\mathbb{R}^{m}$). Now let $x=\Psi (y)$ be a coordinate change on M and $u_2=M(y)u_1$ a transformation of the input $u_1$ of the first system. By applying these maps on the system, you get the new equations  $\dot y=F(y)u_2$. As you may notice, F is the same in both systems. The problem is why is this happening i.e. for what systems and transformations does this property hold?

A little more elaboration

It is useful to investigate the maps more closely. In the general case one has

$\dot x=D\Psi \dot y$
$\dot x= F(x)u_1$

thus
$\dot y=D\Psi ^{-1} F(x)u_1$, (1)

where $D\Psi$ is the Jacobian matrix of $\Psi$. In our case it actually turns out that:  

$\dot y=F(y)M(y)u_1$. (2)

You can then consider that $u_2=M(y)u_1$ and get the final system,

$\dot y=F(y)u_2$,

that is, the same system.
 By (1),(2) you get,

$D\Psi ^{-1} F(x)u_1=F(y)M(y)u_1 \Rightarrow (D\Psi ^{-1} F(x)-F(y)M(y))u_1=0$. 

Since this holds for every $u_1$, you have the condition,

$F(\Psi (y))=D\Psi F(y)M(y)$

So, what does this condition imply? What systems F and maps $\Psi$ hold this property (of system invariance)? I should note that F is nonlinear and a case study where this actually happens is the kinematic model of a unicycle robot i.e. this. Any ideas?
","This is not a surprising fact for driftless systems to have symmetries. In our previous work we considered only nonlinear systems with drift and classified the symmetries accordingly. In case of a driftless system
\dot x=F(x)u you can interpret $F$ (that's what it is) as a distribution of vector fields $f_1, \dots, f_m$ (column vectors of the matrix) and whenever such distribution is involutive ($[f_i, f_j]=\lambda_1(x)f_1+\cdots+\lambda_m(x)f_m$ then necessarily the system admits nontrivial symmetries (this is due to the Frobenius Theorem). That's the case you have here with the unicycle with $f_1=(\cos \theta, \sin \theta, 0), f_2=(0,0, 1)$. I can write in more extensive way but I hope you would get the idea from there.

The typical suggestion is to never use ECB, but if there is just a single block being encrypted, is it a concern?

The reason I want to use ECB is because I want the encrypted value of the block to be consistent between encryptions for other reasons (so I can check if a value already exists by just comparing the uniqueness of the cipherText).

Updated: Also note that these encrypted values will be stored in a set, so there will not be data leakage by having multiple encrypted values of the same plainText available.
",edhill,https://crypto.stackexchange.com/users/6569,"16 bytes is 128 bits, which matches the block size of AES-256, but not ""256 bit block"" in the (original) title. Hence the question is ambiguous: was it meant 16, or 32 bytes?

For 16 bytes: ECB reduces to single-block encryption, and yes ECB is safe, for a definition of safe that let one test identity of plaintexts by testing identity of the ciphertexts.

For 32 bytes (e.g. a US SSN encoded in UTF16 or perhaps ASN.1 or XML): no, ECB is unsafe. This extend to any standard block cipher mode of operation modified by fixing IV. Problem is, plaintexts that match in the first block, but not the second, will match in the first block of the ciphertext, but not the second, which leaks information (e.g. in the US SSN format, it allows to cluster plaintexts by identical area number if the block frontier happens to be on the right of that). You need a 256-bit block cipher, such as Rijndael (a superset of AES) instantiated with 256-bit block. There are ways to construct a 256-bit block cipher from AES-256, but I know none with both a sound security argument and either a short statement, or performance close to Rijndael.

Note: Public key encryption can not be used in the context where ""encrypted value of the block (is) to be consistent between encryptions"" and the plaintext is low-entropy (enumerable, or guessable). Here, there are few enough SSNs that they can all be enciphered by anyone (knowing the public key), and compared with the ciphertext, leaking the plaintext.

Update: it is now clear that the question is about 16 bytes. I wonder if some day, UTFx with x>8 will catch in the US.

Updated: Also note that these encrypted values will be stored in a set, so there will not be data leakage by having multiple encrypted values of the same plainText available.
","16 bytes is 128 bits, which matches the block size of AES-256, but not ""256 bit block"" in the (original) title. Hence the question is ambiguous: was it meant 16, or 32 bytes?

For 16 bytes: ECB reduces to single-block encryption, and yes ECB is safe, for a definition of safe that let one test identity of plaintexts by testing identity of the ciphertexts.

For 32 bytes (e.g. a US SSN encoded in UTF16 or perhaps ASN.1 or XML): no, ECB is unsafe. This extend to any standard block cipher mode of operation modified by fixing IV. Problem is, plaintexts that match in the first block, but not the second, will match in the first block of the ciphertext, but not the second, which leaks information (e.g. in the US SSN format, it allows to cluster plaintexts by identical area number if the block frontier happens to be on the right of that). You need a 256-bit block cipher, such as Rijndael (a superset of AES) instantiated with 256-bit block. There are ways to construct a 256-bit block cipher from AES-256, but I know none with both a sound security argument and either a short statement, or performance close to Rijndael.

Note: Public key encryption can not be used in the context where ""encrypted value of the block (is) to be consistent between encryptions"" and the plaintext is low-entropy (enumerable, or guessable). Here, there are few enough SSNs that they can all be enciphered by anyone (knowing the public key), and compared with the ciphertext, leaking the plaintext.

Update: it is now clear that the question is about 16 bytes. I wonder if some day, UTFx with x>8 will catch in the US.

If you were to go with the cloud solution, you would transfer your files to PDFTron's servers, where they will be converted.  Then you would download the converted files.

If you were to go with the on-premises solution, you would need to run DocPub CLI (https://www.pdftron.com/docpub/downloads.html) on your Azure instance, and its only communication with PDFTron would be to increment the billing counter for your PWS account (https://www.pdftron.com/pws/index.html).

",Jared,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/1338,"According to Memory Alpha the supernova was a nearby star, (but supposedly NOT the star Romulus and Remus orbited). This is never clearly explained or diagrammed so we can understand how this happened. (For this example we will assume it was the Romulan star which went nova to explain potential effects.)


  In 2387, a star close to Romulus went supernova, endangering the entire galaxy. Ambassador Spock created a red matter singularity which consumed the star, but not before the supernova reached Romulus, destroying the planet. (Star Trek)




Romulus (and presumably Remus) is destroyed in the supernova.

Given the explosion was clearly seen to engulf Romulus in a fiery wake, the star had to be relatively close, otherwise, the Romulans would have (and should have) been able to evacuate in a timely fashion.

Normally, any planets within the orbit of a star going supernova are more than likely destroyed in the resulting blast. Remus was the third planet in the Romulan star system so it was likely as destroyed as Romulus was.

In a normal supernova, the energy of the explosion is strong enough to strip away even the dense atmospheres of local gas giants, leaving only their metallic or compressed matter cores. Depending on the size of the star and the distance between the local stars, nearby star systems can be affected by gamma ray and other radiation effects.


  During this short interval of a star explosion, a supernova can radiate as much energy as the Sun is expected to emit over its entire life span. The explosion expels much or all of a star's material at a velocity of up to 30,000 km/s (10% of the speed of light), driving a shock wave into the surrounding interstellar medium. This shock wave sweeps up an expanding shell of gas and dust called a supernova remnant.

Missiles come in two forms - bomb-pumped lasers and contact nukes.  Both use multi-megaton nuclear initiations to damage enemy ships.

539,539,848,Congenital blindness due to retinitis pigmentosa - does it exist?,"Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) patients typically become blind after a period of years in which their eye sight slowly deteriorates due to photoreceptor degeneration. Generally RP patients develop night-blindness first, then tunnel vision, after which finally the central eye sight diminishes leaving them with basically no eye sight, bar some crude light perception. The wiki page on RP has more information when needed. Typically, the process from diagnosis of RP to (near) complete loss of eye sight takes years to decades.

However, Chebat et al. (2007) make mention that their study group, consisting of congenitally blind subjects, includes one person with RP (see table 1 in the linked article). Hence, this implicates that this particular subject was blind from birth due to effects of RP. 

Is anyone familiar with newborns blinded by the effects of RP?

2102,2102,3346,Mechanic says not to use top three/bottom two gears or the chain will throw,"I just bought a BTwin Fit 5, all stock, fresh from the distributor, Decathlon. Took it for light pacing at the store and things seemed OK. About 100 metres out the door, I shift up to the top end of the range, pedalling firmly but not hard, and it promptly throws the chain to the outside.

Returning to the store, the mechanic puts the chain back on, adjusts the tension on the derailleurs and tells me not to use the top three or bottom two gears (i.e., the 3 highest resistance and two lowest resistance shift positions in the drive train's range), or the chain will throw again. I asked why, but unfortunately, I'm a foreigner and don't speak the local language well enough to understand any of his explanation. Please note I definitely did not misunderstand the bit about not using the gears; this was crystal clear. 

Wild speculations on what he may have said about the reasons for this:


Chain tension or play due to the lateral shift between the inner and outer gears of the front and rear cassettes when shifting
Chain length
Something about the derailleurs


Again, there's a substantial language barrier and I have zero confidence in my understanding of what he said about why I shouldn't use those gears.

If you're not familiar with Decathlon, it's a sports department/box/super store. Definitely not a high end or dedicated bike shop. The house mechanic struck me as less than an expert, to put it gently. I've definitely read some reviews online griping about the inability of Decathlon staff to correctly set up the drive trains of new bikes. However, it's important to understand that this quality of expertise is representative of (or better than) that of every shop within an hour's travel.

This advice seems utterly mad to me. What on earth could be the reasoning behind this? What can I do about it? Aside from the obvious of taking it to a better mechanic, as that presents substantial difficulty for me on a number of fronts. The bike shifts without a problem, including before the throw. I did test out every gear during my test ride. I haven't yet experimented with trying to reproduce the problem yet; I'll do so in the next few days most likely.

The bike has a Shimano Sora groupset and Shimano Deore shifters. I'm an experienced rider but no mechanic; I haven't done anything beyond basic maintenance myself. I can provide additional pictures and am game to make relatively minor adjustments, but even just clearly nailing down the issue would be considerably useful.

I have one head of the chain enchanted with +1 Sweeping, and the other head with +2.

My question is, if I have the +2 end as my main attack, and the +1 as offhand, can I still choose to make a Trip attack with the +1 end anytime I choose?
How easy is it to switch the ends of a double weapon?
",EisenKreutzer,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/11719,"tl;dr: Yes, you may attack freely with either end of a double weapon, except when using Two-Weapon Fighting, where the offhand attack cannot be made with the same end as the main attack.

You may use any weapon you are wielding for any attack. You may choose which wielded weapon you use independently of the choice you made for any previous attacks; that is, you are never &ldquo;locked in&rdquo; to any particular weapon (or &ldquo;locked out&rdquo; for that matter, with one major exception explained below).

Choosing a weapon for an attack is not even a free action; it is a non-action component of the attack itself. There is not actually any point where you &ldquo;change&rdquo; which weapon you are using; each attack simply lets you choose a weapon, independently of any prior attacks you may have made.

Thus you may use a different weapon for each attack, or the same weapon over and over, or whatever. For double weapons, this means that both ends are available for any given attack. It does not matter if the previous attack was in the last round, or was an attack of opportunity just before your turn, or was a previous attack in a full-attack: the weapon you choose to use for this attack is completely independent of the weapon you chose to use for any previous attacks.

Note that choosing to use different weapons for each attack in a full-attack does not constitute using Two-Weapon Fighting. If you have multiple attacks for iteratives, haste, or whatever else, you may choose the weapon you use for each attack independently, and you take no penalty for choosing a different weapon than the last attack. You only take a penalty when you explicitly use Two-Weapon Fighting to get a bonus attack. This bonus attack is also the aforementioned big exception.

Big Exception: Two-Weapon Fighting

There is one major exception to the general case where you may use any wielded weapon: Two-Weapon Fighting (or Multiweapon Fighting). These combat options give a bonus attack, known as an offhand attack, but this offhand attack must be made with a different weapon than the main attack that it is paired with (and in the case of Multiweapon Fighting, a weapon different from any prior offhand attacks in the same set).

In other words, you are not free to choose a weapon you have already used when taking the bonus attacks offered by Two-Weapon or Multiweapon Fighting.

Double weapons explain that, as a special exception to the Two-Weapon Fighting rules, you may use the same double weapon for both attacks when using Two-Weapon Fighting, but they must be made with separate ends of the double weapon, and you take attack penalties as if you were wielding a one-handed weapon and a light weapon.

This is the only time where one end of the double weapon would not be available as an option for an attack: if you used an end as the main attack when Two-Weapon Fighting, the bonus attack must be made with the other end.

Also, note that you do not &ldquo;have&rdquo; one end as main and the other as offhand. The terms main and offhand are not used, and have no meaning, except during Two-Weapon Fighting. If you are not using Two-Weapon Fighting, it&rsquo;s just an attack, not main or offhand or anything else. Two-Weapon Fighting and the main/offhand designations apply only during the full-attack in which you use Two-Weapon Fighting; as soon as that full-attack completes, both ends become equal again (including for attacks of opportunity during that round).

Edit :
I include the image for ripple effect that I think I have to use for weapon fire.

Also I include code that I use to create ripple effect. Similar code with some changes I used to create live wallpaper and it work perfectly. But in normal game activity I don't able to find my mistake. So please guide on this

Because suddenly fps goes down.

",Michael,https://crypto.stackexchange.com/users/4311,"Updated answer:

No, this is not possible with cryptography.
You have the ciphertext and you have the key.
For all anyone knows, you could have made a copy of those to some other computer and decrypted the ciphertext without telling anyone.
There's no way (with cryptography) to prove you haven't done that.

One approach would be to implement a secure service and hire an independent auditor to audit your code and architecture and certify that you appear to have set things up in a way that protects your customers' data.  You could hire an independent security pro to review your system and write a public report that customers can view.  I don't know if this would give potential customers a better sense of comfort or if it would be worth the money.

The only approach I can think of, to solve this through technical means, would be to use trusted computing.  Trusted computing relies upon trusted hardware (TPMs), and its support for remote attestation would allow you to prove to others what code you are running.  You could publish the source to your software to allow anyone to verify that your software doesn't make a copy of their keys or their data, and use remote attestation to prove that you're using that good software.

However, using trusted computing in this way is extremely complicated.  Trusted computing is bleeding-edge stuff; it's an engineering and management hassle of major proportions.  Moreover, most customers probably won't have the patience, skills, or desire to undertake all of the tasks that would be required to verify that your system works properly.

So, I think there's no technical solution for your problem.  You'll have to rely upon your customer's trust, your reputation, contractual guarantees, and other social/legal means, instead of technical solutions.

A comment: your problem is more an information security problem than a cryptography problem.  Are you familiar with IT Security?



Original answer:

I think you need to define the problem better, to identify who are the principals/participants and what is the threat model.

If the decryptor knows the ciphertext and decryption key and wants to subvert the protocol, you cannot prove that the decryptor didn't decrypt the ciphertext.

The decryptor can prove that he did decrypt the ciphertext (using a zero-knowledge proof of knowledge, possibly with some timestamping).  However, he cannot prove that he read the decrypted message or paid attention to it or acted on it, so I suspect this will be basically useless in practice.

If you can limit access to the ciphertext or the decryption key, then you can prove some partial statements.  For instance, if you don't release the ciphertext to anyone until time $t$, you can prove that no one could possibly have decrypted it before time $t$.  If you know the key, though, you won't be able to prove that you didn't release it before time $t$ (except possibly through use of TPMs / trusted computing), so you'll probably need to be trusted for this to be meaningful.

There are many other possible scenarios -- to propose a specific solution, we'll probably need to know the threat model and requirements in a bit more detail.

2257,2257,3598,How to synchronize actions like jump in multiplayer?,"I am a newbie game developer and I have been researching about multiplayer games. I observed that there's always some latency, the players always get updates from past actions. But there are techniques like dead reckoning to handle the latency. I can predict the movement and make movements smooth. But how would I make actions synchronize like jumping, stopped walking, etc.

Suppose, client A was moving, he was at 100m at 10.2 time with 100m/sec velocity and sended this information. Client B would receive this information somewhat later, let it be 10.4. So at client B, I can use prediction and place client A at 120m. But what if, client made a jump at 110m at 10.3. I can't predict that and since I have been using prediction I can't show client A jump in past.

I may deal with this problem by not sending jump action at all. But what if my game has some voids where players can fall and die. So, If I don't sync jump actions, other players will observe that one player was running then he falls in void and then again appear on the screen destroying the visual engagement. 

Jump is just an example, there might many scenarios where prediction can't work. So, How do deal with them. One such example can be Multiplayer Online battle arena games like Awesomenauts.

I observed that there's always some latency, the players always get updates from past actions. But there are techniques like dead reckoning to handle the latency. I can predict the movement and make movements smooth. But how would I make actions synchronize like jumping, stopped walking, etc.

Suppose, client A was moving, he was at 100m at 10.2 time with 100m/sec velocity and sended this information. Client B would receive this information somewhat later, let it be 10.4. So at client B, I can use prediction and place client A at 120m. But what if, client made a jump at 110m at 10.3. I can't predict that and since I have been using prediction I can't show client A jump in past.

I may deal with this problem by not sending jump action at all. But what if my game has some voids where players can fall and die. So, If I don't sync jump actions, other players will observe that one player was running then he falls in void and then again appear on the screen destroying the visual engagement. 

Jump is just an example, there might many scenarios where prediction can't work. So, How do deal with them. One such example can be Multiplayer Online battle arena games like Awesomenauts.

",pawel_winzig,https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/users/1027,"Mathematica's interpolation function, Interpolation, works on multidimensional data. For example,

data = Flatten[Table[{x, y, x^2 + y^2}, {x, -10, 10}, {y, -10, 10}], 1];
int = Interpolation[data];


Then, you can extract the values for values between the data points:

int[1.1, 1.1]
(* ==&gt; 2.42 *)


And Plot3D, or whatever else you want.

Plot3D[int[x, y], {x, -10, 10}, {y, -10, 10}]




Note, that the interpolation is pretty good:

exact[x_, y_] := x^2 + y^2
int[1.1, 1.1] == exact[1.1, 1.1]
(* =&gt; True *)


Or better yet (thanks @rcollyer):

(int[1.1, 1.1] - exact[1.1, 1.1])/exact[1.1, 1.1]
(* 1.83508*10^-16 *)




Update Leonid's comment below pointed out that the accuracy of Interpolation will be worse with an unstructured grid. For example:

dataDelete = Delete[data, RandomInteger[{1, Length[data]}]]
intD = Interpolation[dataDelete]


Then,

(intD[1.1, 1.1] - exact[1.1, 1.1])/exact[1.1, 1.1]
(* ==&gt; 0.0743802 *)

What is the easiest way to get interpolation $z = f (x, y) $for a given coordinate ${x, y} $(not in the data list, of course)?","Mathematica's interpolation function, Interpolation, works on multidimensional data. For example,

data = Flatten[Table[{x, y, x^2 + y^2}, {x, -10, 10}, {y, -10, 10}], 1];
int = Interpolation[data];


Then, you can extract the values for values between the data points:

int[1.1, 1.1]
(* ==&gt; 2.42 *)


And Plot3D, or whatever else you want.

Plot3D[int[x, y], {x, -10, 10}, {y, -10, 10}]




Note, that the interpolation is pretty good:

exact[x_, y_] := x^2 + y^2
int[1.1, 1.1] == exact[1.1, 1.1]
(* =&gt; True *)


Or better yet (thanks @rcollyer):

(int[1.1, 1.1] - exact[1.1, 1.1])/exact[1.1, 1.1]
(* 1.83508*10^-16 *)




Update Leonid's comment below pointed out that the accuracy of Interpolation will be worse with an unstructured grid. For example:

dataDelete = Delete[data, RandomInteger[{1, Length[data]}]]
intD = Interpolation[dataDelete]


Then,

(intD[1.1, 1.1] - exact[1.1, 1.1])/exact[1.1, 1.1]
(* ==&gt; 0.0743802 *)


which is worse. It seems particularly bad close to the origin:

Plot3D[(intD[x, y] - exact[x, y])/ exact[x, y], {x, -10, 10}, {y, -10, 10}]

4312,4312,6869,How do animal perceive distances with their eyes and ears,"I am studying how animals (including the human beings) can perceive distances thanks to their eyes and their ears. I am focusing on the fact that they always go in pairs: two eyes, two ears, etc.

About the sight, I think our eyes use the parallax. But is this enough? Is this the only way we can perceive distances with them?

About the sounds, I think it is merely by interferometry, but I am not convinced, because the distances between our ears and the wavelength are not always comparable to one another.

What do you think about it?

1972,1972,3142,Logic problem: Atiyah-Macdonald 1.11,"Proposition 1.11 in Atiyah-Macdonald's ""Introduction to commutative algebra"" states the following: 

""Given an ideal $I$ in a ring $A$ and $p_1, \dots p_n$ prime ideals, then $I \subset \cup_i p_i$ implies that $I\subset p_j$ for some $j\in \{1, \dots, n\}.$ ""

"
3809,3809,6054,How should I tell Rails which of these content types to load for a given feed?,"I have content management system for an iOS app built with rails. Right now there a are three different types of content. The first two are just strings uploaded into a textfield by the user. One is twitter handles and hashtags, the other is URLs. The second type is photos. 

The user can upload as many individual instances of these types content as he/she wants to given a feed which will is the then passed to the iOS app via an API call to display. 

The current approach I am using is to have Feed, Picture, Twitter, and Webpage models. When the user crates a new Feed, they then associate the appropriate content with that feed via a one to many relationship between each Feed instance it's content instances. 

When it comes time to display to content the user has uploaded, a GET request for a given stream is generated and the Feed model then does the following awful thing determine what type of content should be shown: 

 def Feed.get_content_for_feed(feed_id)
    return self.map_type_to_class(feed_id).get_content_for_feed(feed_id)
  end

  private

  def Feed.map_type_to_class(feed_id)
    feed_type_id = Feed.find(feed_id).feed_type_id
    not_yet_implemented = nil
    case stream_type_id
      when 1
        return Webpages
      when 2
        return Pictures
      when 3
        return not_yet_implemented
      when 4
        return Twitter
      when 5
        return not_yet_implemented
      when 6
        return not_yet_implemented
      when 7
        return not_yet_implemented
      when 8
        return not_yet_implemented
      else
        return nil

    end
  end


Then each content class implements a get_content_for_feed method to return the content:

def Twitter.get_content_for_feed(feed_id)
    tweet_urls = self.where(:feed_id =&gt; feed_id.to_i)
    if tweet_urls.empty?
      return []
    else
      return tweet_urls
    end
  end


So it just returns the appropriate class. This works, but I know that it is wrong, but I am not sure what I would be doing. 
",Ryan Collins,https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/52811,"First a light review:

You've got a bug, I think. Your map_type_to_class sets a feed_type_id variable, but your case statement is looking at a stream_type_id variable that I don't see anywhere.

Second, don't use so many return statements. It's Ruby; returns are implicit. So this you don't need returns in if...else or case branches you have in your question. In idomatic Ruby, you only see return if someone specifically wants to exit a method early (and even that's rare with well-factored code).

Lastly, this bit is redundant

tweet_urls = self.where(:feed_id =&gt; feed_id.to_i)
if tweet_urls.empty?
  return []
else
  return tweet_urls
end


Which, to all intents and purposes is the same as simply:

self.where(:feed_id =&gt; feed_id.to_i)


It's implicitly returned, and it's array-like, so there's no need to do anything special. It's either empty or it's not. If you want something that's truly an Array instance (and not just duck-typed), you can append a .to_a.

Anyway, what you're looking for is the constantize method for strings. What you've got is a fairly simple has_many relationship, you just want something like a string item_type column on your Feed model that contains the class name (as a string) instead of your current numeric ID.

From there it's a matter of implementing a polymorphic has_many (Rails already has a polymorphic option for belongs_to but that's a to-one association).

You could simply do

def Feed
  def items
    klass = item_type.constantize
    klass.where(feed_id: id)
  end
end


(yes that could just be one line).

You won't have all the fancy collection methods, caching, and other nice stuff Rails provides for regular associations, but you can add that if you want or simply make do without it (I recommend the latter unless you find it to be bigger hassle).

So in your FeedsController (or wherever), you're looking at something like

def show
  feed = Feed.find(params[:id])
  render json: feed.items
end


That should work as a super-minimal implementation. The point is really just that you store the class name, which you can then turn from a string into a class name constant with constantize.



Alternatively, you could use Rails' built-in associations, but there's more setup involved and it's not as clean to look at. Again, you'll want an item_type string column.

def Feed
  has_many :webpages # the class name Webpage is implicit
  has_many :pictures
  has_many :twitters # yuck, not a good name, but it'll imply the Twitter class

  def items
    association = item_type.underscore.pluralize # convert a class name to an association name
    send(associtation) # call the association method (e.g. `webpages`)
  end
end


The main advantage is that the items method is just a shortcut that provides the correct association object, so you have all the usual convenience methods. So you can do something like this for a webpage-type feed

Feed.find(some_id).items.create(params[:url])


Of course, the major issue is that it's not clear what's going on. Is items a collection of Picture? Of Webpage? If you just blindly try to create a Picture record from params meant for a webpage, things get messy.

So I'd stick to the first version, where items isn't an opaque alias for an association, and instead work a bit harder when adding new records and such.

888,888,1409,Words for meat differ from the words for the corresponding animal,"In English we have:


""beef"" for ""cow"", ""cattle""
""veal"" for ""calf""
""pork"" for ""pig""
""mutton"" for ""sheep""


I'm not aware of this separation for ""fish"", ""goat"" or ""chicken"" (Spanish has ""pollo"" and ""gallina"") and other poultry. Are these words used simply to distinguish the meat from the animal (i.e. to avoid saying ""cow meat"") or is there a psychological separation to avoid the association? I doubt the latter since these words developed when people were likely less squeamish than some are today. 

Why are there not meat words for some animals?

I'm not aware of this separation for ""fish"", ""goat"" or ""chicken"" (Spanish has ""pollo"" and ""gallina"") and other poultry. Are these words used simply to distinguish the meat from the animal (i.e. to avoid saying ""cow meat"") or is there a psychological separation to avoid the association? I doubt the latter since these words developed when people were likely less squeamish than some are today. 

Why are there not meat words for some animals? 

What are some others I didn't list?
","A cow is made up of more than its meat so referring to the muscle with a different name to the entire animal isn't that hard to swallow. How the meat is prepared and even the age of the animal can give the meat a different name too. e.g. pork, bacon and ham or lamb and mutton.

When I developed the reports, I used a direct Oracle server connection (server address, username/password, SID, port, etc.) and the report worked perfectly. As a limit on our LMS, we're told that we must use ODBC connections instead of a direct Oracle Server connection, but, when I connect the Crystal Report to the Stored Procedure in this manner, I get a persistent Error 42000:[Oracle][ODBC] Syntax Error or Access Violation error.

We have double-checked the drivers and we're up to date. We have verified there are no actual syntax errors in the code. We have verified the username we're logging in as has the correct privileges to run the Oracle Stored Procedure. We've verified that, when supplied with the correct parameters, the Stored Procedure runs.

What I'm seeing that I cannot explain is this. There are 4 input parameters to the report and there are 36 returned columns in the recordset that comes back from the stored procedure. Inside Crystal Reports, when I got to Database &gt; Show SQL Query, I get the following:

Which shows the 36 returned columns as INPUT parameters (which it should not) as NULL values and then the 4 input parameters: 'STR0115', '4260', NULL, 'course' which are correctly listed.

So, I think there's a mismatch between the parameters that are being passed to the Stored Procedure and what the Stored Procedure expects, generating the error.

For reference, here's the header of the Stored Procedure:

The DataReturn SysRefCursor is what contains the 36 returned columns.

First, /dev/sda is NOT recognized correctly! This disk is 500GB. 

Second, mounting /dev/sda2 is not possible:

mount: special device /dev/sda2 does not exist
# although fdisk -l showed this device !


Third, trying to format the disk, it really sees only the sectors until 320GB:
When I start fdisk I am warned:

Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
After that, of course, the previous content won't be recoverable.

Command (m for help): w
The partition table has been altered!

I have other USB hard drives with 320GB and they really mount fine. 


Is this a limitation of RPi? Or a problem with this specific Hard Drive?   
How can I use this large disk with my RPi? 


update: solved the issue with help of the commentators here...

here is what I did ...


I thought I have some weired issue with Debian Wheezy &amp; gparted. So, I reformatted the hard drive to NTFS. Before that I ERASED the partition table. 
And created a new single NTFS partition. 
Bingo! RPi, identified the partition. However, it claimed my Drive is now 2TB big, and recommended I will use GPT:

whoops! That is WRONG!

So, I disconnected the hard drive again. re-connented it to my laptop. I erased the partition table again, and re-created the partition table using fdisk on RPi! not on my laptop! This time, I took a short cut, and created the disk partition with ext4 directly. 
    I plugged the hard-drive to RPi and BINGO!

conclusion (?)

My guess is that gparted in Debian Wheezy includes some nasty bug which is sometimes showing it's ugly face. I would report a bug if I had more solid evidence. But ... since I have only one 500GB hard drive, and I don't want to
risk the health of this hard drive reformatting it so many time, I will settle this with it. If you happen to bump into this post, and you have had similar problems with large SATA drives and partitioning on wheezy, I would be happy to know.
",Oz123,https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/users/3505,"The comments on the original post are getting too long, so here is my answer.
I suspect that it's the drive itself. Maybe try update your Raspberry Pi and then try again.

To update
    sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade

Then try to access the drive. If this does still not work. I'd recommend trying to find someone with a HDD at least the same size or bigger and test that.

I created 2 partitions (180GB and 320GB).
RPi would only recognize the first partition. 

So, I tried creating the partitions using the raspberrypi. Here are my surprising findings:

First, /dev/sda is NOT recognized correctly! This disk is 500GB. 

Second, mounting /dev/sda2 is not possible:

root@raspberrypi:/home/ozn# mount -t ext4 /dev/sda2 /media/usbhdd1/
mount: special device /dev/sda2 does not exist
# although fdisk -l showed this device !


Third, trying to format the disk, it really sees only the sectors until 320GB:
When I start fdisk I am warned:

Building a new DOS disklabel with disk identifier 0x6784fc4b.
Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
After that, of course, the previous content won't be recoverable.

Warning: invalid flag 0x0000 of partition table 4 will be corrected by w(rite)

Command (m for help): w
The partition table has been altered!

Calling ioctl() to re-read partition table.
Syncing disks.


I have other USB hard drives with 320GB and they really mount fine. 


Is this a limitation of RPi? Or a problem with this specific Hard Drive?   
How can I use this large disk with my RPi? 


update: solved the issue with help of the commentators here...

here is what I did ...


I thought I have some weired issue with Debian Wheezy &amp; gparted. So, I reformatted the hard drive to NTFS. Before that I ERASED the partition table. 
And created a new single NTFS partition. 
Bingo! RPi, identified the partition. However, it claimed my Drive is now 2TB big, and recommended I will use GPT:

root@raspberrypi:/home/ozn# fdisk -l /dev/sda

whoops! That is WRONG!

So, I disconnected the hard drive again. re-connented it to my laptop. I erased the partition table again, and re-created the partition table using fdisk on RPi! not on my laptop! This time, I took a short cut, and created the disk partition with ext4 directly. 
    I plugged the hard-drive to RPi and BINGO!

1551,1551,2433,What is the Roman Catholic view of Christian perfection or entire sanctification?,"Does the RC Church have a view on Christian perfection or entire sanctification? If so what is it? To what degree do they believe believers can experience any amount of freedom from sin in this life?
",Matthew Morley,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/15007,"Essentially the answer is ""No, for most people the believer cannot be perfectly free from sin in this lifetime. Indeed, the case is even worse. We must constantly fight against the concupiscence (bias toward sin) we inherit through original sin. Through God's grace present in the Sacraments the believer may gain forgiveness of sins, and she must aim for perfection throughout her life, but she cannot hope to achieve it for more than a relatively short amount of time, so that she must be constantly on guard against sin."" Catholicism does not admit the impossibility of perfection in this lifetime, but does point out its obvious rarity and difficulty ""since all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."" All is not lost, however, because any lack of perfection is rectified after death in purgatory. It's theologically inescapable that this must occur either before or after death because Rev 21:27 makes clear that nothing in any way imperfect or impure or sinful can be in God's presence.

""Entire sanctification"" is not a phrase typically used in Catholic theology. It's a fair question, though, to ask ""To what extent do Catholics believe Christians can be free from sin in this life?""

Certainly believers are called to strive for perfection:


  All the faithful of Christ of whatever rank or status, are called to the fullness of the Christian life and to the perfection of charity.


(Lumen Gentium, section 40)

In Article 4 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, titled ""The Sacrament of Penance and Reconciliation"", we find a reminder:


  ""You were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God"" [1 Corinthians 6:11] One must appreciate the magnitude of the gift God has given us in the sacraments of Christian initiation in order to grasp the degree to which sin is excluded for him who has ""put on Christ."" But the apostle John also says: ""If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.""


(Catechism, paragraph 425)

Catholics believe that the Virgin Mary was not only free from original sin, but entirely free from personal sin throughout her whole life. However, this was a special grace of God for her, not a result purely of her own effort:


  The Fathers of the Eastern tradition call the Mother of God “the All–Holy” (Panagia) and celebrate her as ""free from any stain of sin, as though fashioned by the Holy Spirit and formed as a new creature."" By the grace of God Mary remained free of every personal sin her whole life long.


(Catechism, paragraph 493; emphasis added)

This special grace, called the Immaculate Conception, was given only to Mary to equip her for the unique task of bearing God in her womb. It was a special appropriation of the merits of Christ obtained on the cross and applied out of the sequence of time so that Mary, too, receives salvation only through the one door to the Father, Jesus Christ. Note that we too, obtain whatever level of perfection we do in this life through grace, specifically sanctifying grace. It is not by our own merits that we are sanctified, but rather the gifts we receive from the Holy Spirit. These gifts are imparted to us through the sacraments by the Holy Spirit from the store of merits earned by Christ on Calvary. From the Catechism of the Catholic Church:


  1999 The grace of Christ is the gratuitous gift that God makes to us
  of his own life, infused by the Holy Spirit into our soul to heal it
  of sin and to sanctify it. It is the sanctifying or deifying grace
  received in Baptism. It is in us the source of the work of
  sanctification:48
  
  Therefore if any one is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has
  passed away, behold, the new has come. All this is from God, who
  through Christ reconciled us to himself.49
  
  2000 Sanctifying grace is an habitual gift, a stable and supernatural
  disposition that perfects the soul itself to enable it to live with
  God, to act by his love. Habitual grace, the permanent disposition to
  live and act in keeping with God's call, is distinguished from actual
  graces which refer to God's interventions, whether at the beginning of
  conversion or in the course of the work of sanctification.


Concerning purgatory, Augustine said, in The City of God, that ""temporary punishments are suffered by some in this life only, by others after death, by others both now and then; but all of them before that last and strictest judgment"" (21:13) thus indicating that no one stays in purgatory past the general judgement. The decision of whether a soul goes to heaven, purgatory and then heaven, or hell is made at the particular judgement where an individual's life is evaluated. From the Catechism again:


  1030 All who die in God's grace and friendship, but still imperfectly
  purified, are indeed assured of their eternal salvation; but after
  death they undergo purification, so as to achieve the holiness
  necessary to enter the joy of heaven.
  
  1031 The Church gives the name Purgatory to this final purification of
  the elect, which is entirely different from the punishment of the
  damned.606 The Church formulated her doctrine of faith on Purgatory
  especially at the Councils of Florence and Trent. The tradition of the
  Church, by reference to certain texts of Scripture, speaks of a
  cleansing fire:607
  
  As for certain lesser faults, we must believe that, before the Final 
  Judgment, there is a purifying fire. He who is truth says that
  whoever utters blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will be pardoned
  neither in this age nor in the age to come. From this sentence we

If so, what is it? To what extent do they believe believers will be free from sin in this life?","Essentially the answer is ""No, for most people the believer cannot be perfectly free from sin in this lifetime. Indeed, the case is even worse. We must constantly fight against the concupiscence (bias toward sin) we inherit through original sin. Through God's grace present in the Sacraments the believer may gain forgiveness of sins, and she must aim for perfection throughout her life, but she cannot hope to achieve it for more than a relatively short amount of time, so that she must be constantly on guard against sin."" Catholicism does not admit the impossibility of perfection in this lifetime, but does point out its obvious rarity and difficulty ""since all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."" All is not lost, however, because any lack of perfection is rectified after death in purgatory. It's theologically inescapable that this must occur either before or after death because Rev 21:27 makes clear that nothing in any way imperfect or impure or sinful can be in God's presence.

""Entire sanctification"" is not a phrase typically used in Catholic theology. It's a fair question, though, to ask ""To what extent do Catholics believe Christians can be free from sin in this life?""

Certainly believers are called to strive for perfection:


  All the faithful of Christ of whatever rank or status, are called to the fullness of the Christian life and to the perfection of charity.


(Lumen Gentium, section 40)

In Article 4 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, titled ""The Sacrament of Penance and Reconciliation"", we find a reminder:


  ""You were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God"" [1 Corinthians 6:11] One must appreciate the magnitude of the gift God has given us in the sacraments of Christian initiation in order to grasp the degree to which sin is excluded for him who has ""put on Christ."" But the apostle John also says: ""If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.""


(Catechism, paragraph 425)

Catholics believe that the Virgin Mary was not only free from original sin, but entirely free from personal sin throughout her whole life. However, this was a special grace of God for her, not a result purely of her own effort:


  The Fathers of the Eastern tradition call the Mother of God “the All–Holy” (Panagia) and celebrate her as ""free from any stain of sin, as though fashioned by the Holy Spirit and formed as a new creature."" By the grace of God Mary remained free of every personal sin her whole life long.


(Catechism, paragraph 493; emphasis added)

This special grace, called the Immaculate Conception, was given only to Mary to equip her for the unique task of bearing God in her womb. It was a special appropriation of the merits of Christ obtained on the cross and applied out of the sequence of time so that Mary, too, receives salvation only through the one door to the Father, Jesus Christ. Note that we too, obtain whatever level of perfection we do in this life through grace, specifically sanctifying grace. It is not by our own merits that we are sanctified, but rather the gifts we receive from the Holy Spirit. These gifts are imparted to us through the sacraments by the Holy Spirit from the store of merits earned by Christ on Calvary. From the Catechism of the Catholic Church:


  1999 The grace of Christ is the gratuitous gift that God makes to us
  of his own life, infused by the Holy Spirit into our soul to heal it
  of sin and to sanctify it. It is the sanctifying or deifying grace
  received in Baptism. It is in us the source of the work of
  sanctification:48
  
  Therefore if any one is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has
  passed away, behold, the new has come. All this is from God, who
  through Christ reconciled us to himself.49
  
  2000 Sanctifying grace is an habitual gift, a stable and supernatural
  disposition that perfects the soul itself to enable it to live with
  God, to act by his love. Habitual grace, the permanent disposition to
  live and act in keeping with God's call, is distinguished from actual
  graces which refer to God's interventions, whether at the beginning of
  conversion or in the course of the work of sanctification.


Concerning purgatory, Augustine said, in The City of God, that ""temporary punishments are suffered by some in this life only, by others after death, by others both now and then; but all of them before that last and strictest judgment"" (21:13) thus indicating that no one stays in purgatory past the general judgement. The decision of whether a soul goes to heaven, purgatory and then heaven, or hell is made at the particular judgement where an individual's life is evaluated. From the Catechism again:


  1030 All who die in God's grace and friendship, but still imperfectly
  purified, are indeed assured of their eternal salvation; but after
  death they undergo purification, so as to achieve the holiness
  necessary to enter the joy of heaven.
  
  1031 The Church gives the name Purgatory to this final purification of
  the elect, which is entirely different from the punishment of the
  damned.606 The Church formulated her doctrine of faith on Purgatory
  especially at the Councils of Florence and Trent. The tradition of the
  Church, by reference to certain texts of Scripture, speaks of a
  cleansing fire:607
  
  As for certain lesser faults, we must believe that, before the Final 
  Judgment, there is a purifying fire. He who is truth says that
  whoever utters blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will be pardoned
  neither in this age nor in the age to come. From this sentence we
  understand that certain offenses can be forgiven in this age, but
  certain others in the age to come.608

1952,1952,3111,Why would we need to ground an AC source?,"I'm new to this field hence this weird question. Why would we need to ground an AC source? Why wouldn't it be enough to have just one pole to get an AC current going? I understand why it wouldn't work in DC case where current is flowing in one direction. However, in case of AC source where the current is not flowing anywhere but rather just oscillating back and forth it's not that clear to me why connecting load to only one pole wouldn't work?
",RuslanM,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/40908,"Electric circuits are always a complete path, which is the very definition of circuit. In a DC circuit, current flows from one pole to another in a constant, direct manner. In an AC circuit, current also flows from one pole to another, but it changes voltage and direction many times per second. (With mains power, this is 50 or 60 times per second, depending on where you live.)

It's not correct to say that with an AC source ""current is not flowing anywhere but rather just oscillating back and forth."" Current is flowing, but it is changing direction rapidly.

Let's take a moment and do an analogy - mind you, not a great analogy, but one I think that may help. Take a band saw for example. There is a metal blade with teeth that is essentially a ring (a band, which is where the tool gets its name) wrapped around two drums. When you turn on the saw, the blade moves in one direction, and you pass material into the blade to cut. You can think of the band as direct current, always moving in one direction, making a complete circuit.

If you think of a hand saw, where you oscillate the blade back and forth, the analogy falls apart, because there is not a complete circuit. In order for electric current to flow, there must be a complete circuit. It may be that this sort of idea is what has confused you with regard to alternating current. Because it is possible to move a saw blade by only acting on it from one side, you might assume a similar effect could be achieved with electric current.

Instead, imagine that the blade must always be continuous, thus we're back to the band saw. This time, let's say the tool moves the blade up and down (like a jig saw) and the teeth on the blade are modified to cut in both directions. You can still pass material into the blade to cut, but you're always cutting with the same section of blade, assuming that the movement in each direction is the same. Each time the blade moves up, it has to stop and reverse direction. The same is true with the downward cut. Think of these momentary stops as the point at which the AC voltage source is at 0 volts (the zero crossing).

Unlike a battery, an AC voltage source is always changing the voltage potential of the two poles, in an equal and opposite manner. When one pole is at a positive voltage, the other pole (with respect to the first) is at a negative voltage. As the voltage of one pole changes, the other is mirroring it. Current flows from one to the other, always.

Now about that ground thing... When you consider an AC source and a load, you basically have two connections. One pole to one side of a load, and the other pole to the other side of the load. Neither pole is really ground, because they're both just opposite sides of the AC source. You can call one of them ground, but realize that doing so is just a reference. If you decide that pole ""B"" is ""ground"" then you're essentially saying all voltage measurements should be with respect to that pole. If you were to measure any part of the circuit with a voltmeter, you would connect the black probe to the wire you've labeled as ""ground"" and all readings would be based on that as a reference.

In most household electrical circuits and appliances, ground is actually a third wire. The two poles I mentioned earlier are called ""hot"" and ""neutral"" (black and white wires in the US), and ""ground"" is the bare copper wire (or often green). The purpose for this ground is safety. A simple appliance might have a metal enclosure, which is connected to ground. Hot and neutral enter the appliance to power it. If something were to go wrong, like a wire came loose inside, if the chassis were not grounded, touching it could result in an electric shock. Having the chassis grounded instead diverts current back to Earth ground, usually in a very abrupt manner, such that the circuit breaker trips and power is cut off.

Mind you, this is a simplified explanation, but I hope it helps you understand the basic concept of AC and to differentiate between what constitutes the wires of the circuit and ground both as a concept and a physical connection.

3840,3840,6106,More dissonant chords/intervals in the bass clef when frequency proprtions are the same?,"Take for example C augmented. It sounds more consonant in the treble clef above middle C and more dissonant in the bass clef. However the proportions of the frequencies are exactly the same. This doesn't make any sense that it is more dissonant in the bass while the proportions are the same. Frequency proportions being the same should suggest the same amount of dissonance in every octave.

So why are dissonant intervals and chords more dissonant in the bass clef and more consonant in the treble clef? 
",Caters,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/9749,"In general, smaller intervals do not sound as pleasing in a bass register as they do in a treble register. This is a general effect that occurs regardless of whether you play a consonance or a dissonance, although it is more noticeable with dissonances.

What happens is that the overtones of the bass notes end up having more noticeable clashes between them, and those clashes are more audible because they are lower in pitch. When you are in a higher register, the clashing overtones occur at a much higher, and therefore less noticeable range.

One way to get around this is to use a more open voicing. For example, instead of playing C-E-G#, try playing C-G#-E. Unfortunately, that's a tenth, and not playable for many left hands. This is why you often see widely-spaced arpeggios in the left hand of keyboard music.

82,82,135,"What's a better method, using Large Array vs SQL Joins?","I can't decide on w/c technique to go w/... although I am tempted to go the Array way as it is much more straight forward and easier/cleaner to code...

lemme explain in a simple way..

For my messaging app, I have 2 tables


Contacts - contains name, and phone number (currently 5,000+ records)
Messages - messages and the phone number, but not the name of the member


I need to list 1000 Messages, w/ the corresponding phone number and name if possible...

eg.


""Hi dude"" - from 565-1111 (John)
""Bring Cheese"" - from 565-2222 (Bieber)
""Hehehe "" - from 565-2332
""iron man is cool!"" - from 565-7748 (Arnie)


etc...

I would normally join contacts to messages via the phone number... pretty standard stuff...
(but in reality my queries are a bit more complex than a simple left join)

Now, i've been playing around w/ the idea of fetching all contacts and putting it into an array where my app/system could use it in a much easier , more straight forward and cleaner code... where:


query SELECT * contacts


and store them into an array:

contacts['555-7748'] = ""John"";
contacts['555-1111'] = ""Joe"";
contacts['555-2233'] = ""Borat"";
contacts['555-4234'] = ""Arnie"";
etc


this way i can easily lookup the NAME of the Contact via accessing the array, many times in my page/script, just by simply doing:

$name = contacts[$phoneNumber];


I have actually implemented this and it's really cool .. no more join headaches and re-querying contacts table etc.. 

now the question is.. is this OK? Practical? or could i be hitting some memory cap or something here? 

it's basically running JOIN query on EACH message my script outputs
or
store ALL THE CONTACTS/RECORDS into array (memory) and refer to that instead, making queries are more simple.. 
my only worry is, querying thousands of records into an array, may be a bit too much? or is this really OK/practical? specially since there are times when my script needs to fetch specific contacts more than once...

To add, I was also thinking of storing that array into a Session variable! lolz.. so my scripts can simply share this data.. lol 

looking forward to some good inputs
Thanks guys.



---- UPDATE as of 03-31-2013 (Sunday)  ----



Ok... I'm thinking about a totally different approach now..

1) SINCE all this is really me needing  to show the ""CONTACT NAME"" for each message for neat/presentation purposes (better to see the name of the contact on a message rather than phone number yeh?) .... 

2) and since each message will need to show 2 contact names  (receiver and sender) based on their phone numbers on the MESSAGES table..... 

3) I now am thinking of ADDING 2 fields into the MESSAGES table instead... ""sender_name"" and ""receiver_name"" ..  I have seen Bulletin board / Forum software use this technique a lot ..

4) when system receives a message , it checks for existing Contacts entry of the numbers associated w/ the message...and if it exists, get the respective names and include it into storage/insert 

5) ..problem is if during the message was received, contact info isnt available, so no NAMES are saved.. and later CONTACT info is then created... the OLD messages wont show the contact names as intended... 

6) 3 way solution... 1st, evertime a new contact is added/changed my php will make updates to all messages w/ the matching numbers... 2nd, from time to time perhaps once / month, run a ""synchronize routine"" to make sure things are in sync..  or, when a user Actually OPENS a message, mandatory routine will run to check if contact name of that particular message is still in sync w/ the contacts table information... and make updates as necessary.. 

hmmm... better approach you thing? this way, i just need to issue straight forward SELECT queries , simple, fast.. but am able to display the names.. 

then again, i still kinda find that QUICK array reference thing so cool though.. lolz

Then all you need to do is 

include '/secure/lists/contacts.php';


in the pages you need it. You should be careful how you replace the file (copy, save and delete when finished) as well. 

Some other improvements you could make might be to output files for each area code/prefix....

contacts.403.555.inc.php
contacts.403.585.inc.php
contacts.461.550.inc.php


And then create a function to autoload the appropriate file group only as you need them (""lazy loading"") and use static variables to keep the references in the function. This also overcomes the global variable problem, as well as helps keep the functional code accessing the files in a central place. Of course you could use a class, maybe with an array interface implementation.

Anyhow, yet another option could be to use a ini file format.

lemme explain in a simple way..

For my messaging app, I have 2 tables


Contacts - contains name, and phone number (currently 5,000+ records)
Messages - messages and the phone number, but not the name of the member


I need to list 1000 Messages, w/ the corresponding phone number and name if possible...

eg.


""Hi dude"" - from 565-1111 (John)
""Bring Cheese"" - from 565-2222 (Bieber)
""Hehehe "" - from 565-2332
""iron man is cool!"" - from 565-7748 (Arnie)


etc...

I would normally join contacts to messages via the phone number... pretty standard stuff...
(but in reality my queries are a bit more complex than a simple left join)

Now, i've been playing around w/ the idea of fetching all contacts and putting it into an array where my app/system could use it in a much easier , more straight forward and cleaner code... where:


query SELECT * contacts


and store them into an array:

contacts['555-7748'] = ""John"";
contacts['555-1111'] = ""Joe"";
contacts['555-2233'] = ""Borat"";
contacts['555-4234'] = ""Arnie"";
etc


this way i can easily lookup the NAME of the Contact via accessing the array, many times in my page/script, just by simply doing:

$name = contacts[$phoneNumber];


I have actually implemented this and it's really cool .. no more join headaches and re-querying contacts table etc.. 

now the question is.. is this OK? Practical? or could i be hitting some memory cap or something here? 

it's basically running JOIN query on EACH message my script outputs
or
store ALL THE CONTACTS/RECORDS into array (memory) and refer to that instead, making queries are more simple.. 
my only worry is, querying thousands of records into an array, may be a bit too much? or is this really OK/practical? specially since there are times when my script needs to fetch specific contacts more than once...

To add, I was also thinking of storing that array into a Session variable! lolz.. so my scripts can simply share this data.. lol 

looking forward to some good inputs
Thanks guys.

","A little advice, when using the file system in ASP.NET, leverage Server.MapPath:

string[] ssImgs = Directory.GetFiles(Server.MapPath(""~/images/movies""));


where ~/images/movies is the full relative path from the root of the web application.

Secondly, before just grabbing an index of the array, make sure it's actually there. It would be better to change your indexing code to something like this:

Label1.Text = ssImgs.Length &gt;= 1 ? ssImgs[0] : ""File 1 not found."";
Label2.Text = ssImgs.Length &gt;= 2 ? ssImgs[1] : ""File 2 not found."";

3766,3766,5995,Set natbib options after loading natbib package,"Is it possible to set (or change) the natbib package options after its loading (i.e. after the line \usepackage{natbib})?

The reason I need it is that I'm using a LaTeX style from a journal and it has a natbib option which means it ""...handles reference entries in the author-year system by using the natbib package"", according to the journal style documentation, and I need to tune some settings (like 'sort&amp;compress', for example), but I do not know how to do that since I do not load the 'natbib' package directly.

I know there is a command \biboptions{} in Elsevier LaTeX style which does exactly what I want. But as far as I understand, this command is specific to their style and does not belong to the natbib package itself, or am I wrong?

P.S. I'm working with the Springer's 'SVJour3' document class currently. It is a widely used one, I believe. So, maybe someone can suggest me a way to sort the citations so that they do not look like [2,3,1] instead of [1-3] or at least [1,2,3] in the text?

If you wan't to display projects in the users forms (add, edit option) then your associations aren't right. Always make sure that there is an association (with good, conventional tables and keys names) between two model when you want to make a select box, Cake makes it as easy as can it gets.

how can i use this, to display fied projectName in select form field?

thank you in advance!!!
","You can basically do this (in controller):

$this-&gt;set('tasks', $this-&gt;Task-&gt;find('list'));


And make an input with name task_id, and make sure to force it to be a select box, so (in views):

echo $form-&gt;input('task_id', array('label' =&gt; 'youLabelHere', 'type' =&gt; 'select'));

Now, in our case it is not an exception. We don't care it has already been deleted.  We don't want to have to put in a check before the delete and we just want to put in exception handling because it is not really an exception. 

What we would really like to do is not have this exception throw if a delete is attempted and the object is not there.

4836,4836,7690,How to improve or get rid of an Indian English Accent?,"As you might suspect, that the only person who can ask this kind of question must be an Indian. What's wrong with an Indian accent, that makes it difficult for other people to understand. I have communicated with Japanese, Chinese, American and French, and all have told me that your Indian English accent is difficult to understand.

Can anyone tell me how to improve Indian English Accent or get rid of Indian English Accent. Please tell me how to improve specific pronunciation of alphabets, that can help other understand me clearly.
",raj,https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/4219,"Without hearing you speak it's difficult to say what you should work on. Indian English embraces native speakers of many different languages and dialects, and each brings different problems to English pronunciation.

With respect to phonology&mdash;pronunciation of individual sounds, what you call &lsquo;alphabets&rsquo;&dagger;&mdash;this Wikipedia article may help you identify your own points of difficulty.

But in general I&lsquo;m going to guess that the biggest problem your hearers face is not your pronunciation of individual sounds but the tonal contour of your phrases and sentences&mdash;what linguists call &lsquo;prosody&rsquo; or (as in the linked article) &lsquo;supra-segmentals&rsquo;. English listeners tolerate a great deal of variety in the pronunciation of phonemes, but rely very heavily on stress patterns to identify the &lsquo;shape&rsquo; of sentences; and as the article tells you, Indian languages use stress very differently.

To attack this problem I suggest simple imitation. Find recordings of fairly long passages by native speakers of the particular dialect you wish to emulate&mdash;General American or Australian or British Received Pronunciation or Estuary English, or whatever. The recordings should be fairly conversational in tone, not readings from technical or highly &lsquo;literary&rsquo; works; interviews with practised public speakers will do very well, particularly if they are telling stories rather than just giving brief answers to questions. Sit down with the recordings, for twenty or thirty minutes at a time, playing stretches of two or three sentences or so, and try to reproduce exactly what you hear. It will feel very odd and artificial for quite a while, but at some point everything will &lsquo;click&rsquo;: your voice and the recording will have the same lilt and feel. You will then find it very natural to carry that lilt and feel over into your own speech.

That, at any rate, is how I used to learn dialects for stage use. And you should think of it that way, as a role you are playing. You are 'portraying' an English speaker: not losing an Indian accent, but acquiring a specific English accent.



&dagger; This is a problem of a different sort, a lexical one. Alphabet is a common &lsquo;Indianism&rsquo; for Standard English letter. And since English spelling (as you are no doubt painfully aware!) is very far from being phonetic, letter is really not appropriate when speaking of pronunciation.

I'm currently using all four fingers excluding the thumb to tap the guitar. I find my pinky is not as strong as my other fingers when it comes to applying the appropriate strength on the string. What are some exercises I can do to increase my overall finger strength when tapping? More tapping?

Tap softer with the other fingers and tap harder with the pinky finger, slowly and cleanly.  Build up speed keeping the sound clean.
Use hand / finger grips to exercise the fingers, focusing on the pinky.  (Gripmaster, Planet Waves, Xtensor, etc.)
Use finger weights.


Place weights on pinky to make it work harder, which will in turn build strength.  Start off light, slow, and clean -- gradually increasing speed.  After a week or so, increase weight and start back slow.  You can alternate between increasing speed and or increasing weight, depending on what you want to train.


If I were you, I would invest in the finger weights.  I have found them very helpful.  You actually feel faster and stronger after playing with them on and then removing them and playing normally.

After a week or so, increase weight and start back slow.  You can alternate between increasing speed and or increasing weight, depending on what you want to train.


If I were you, I would invest in the finger weights.  I have found them very helpful.  You actually feel faster and stronger after playing with them on and then removing them and playing normally.

Note: I do not consider myself to be an expert guitar player.

You can quickly archive all the unwanted messages by using the quick select shortcut for the main inbox that is on the left side of the taskbar for that inbox. Select all, slap a label on them, and then click archive. They will then only exist under that label, and be hidden from the main inbox. 

Using multiple inboxes and the labels will make sure that any reply that can be associated with a message from the key addresses will appear with the appropriate label attached, and displayed at the top of the specific inbox.

The content is very useful if its’ made the right way (as here on ux.se), but there are plenty of examples where it isn’t. The real question concerns the label which is a convention I’d like to challenge.

History

In 1647 Matthew Hopkins wrote The Discovery of Witches which were introduced as ""Certain Queries answered"" and had the form of a list of Question and Answer, even if the topic is inappropriate by today’s standards. The label FAQ origins from the early 1980s mailing lists where NASA hoped to get new users read the old mail conversations, which were not the case. Instead the same questions were answered again and again and the need for FAQ was born. The acronym FAQ was invented by Eugene Miya and FAQ were later used in mail on a weekly basis at first and later on as a daily mail.


  Today FAQ is more frequently used to refer to the list, and a text consisting of questions and their answers is often called an FAQ regardless of whether the questions are actually frequently asked, if they are asked at all.[1]


Problem

Acronyms are generally bad, since it excludes those who do not know the meaning. They either have to search for the acronym, if they are interested, or just ignore it. If a label is ignored, there is not much use of it and an entire section of valid content is lost by bad labeling. However, it is a very strong web convention which might lead to confusion over time for experienced users.
Also the original meaning have changed (see quote), which also implies that the label would be wrong.

Question

Isn’t the FAQ label obsolete by now? and if so How do we relabel it to suit both experienced and new users?

Also the original meaning have changed (see quote), which also implies that the label would be wrong.

Question

Isn’t the FAQ label obsolete by now? and if so How do we relabel it to suit both experienced and new users?



Edit: I’d really like to know why we can or cannot change the label FAQ. Current answer does not meet that criterion.

[1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAQ
","There is no reason not to relabel a FAQ. In contrast, most popular websites do not use the word. For example, twitter marks its FAQ section as ""help,"" as do Facebook and Google."

Find the id attribute of the ribbon button. eg. Ribbon.EditingTools.CPEditTab.Markup.Html.Menu.Html.EditSource-Menu16. Next go to 14 hive and under TEMPLATE\GLOBAL\XML\ find cmdui.xml file. This file contains definition for all ribbon buttons in SharePoint. Search in this file by word Ribbon.EditingTools.CPEditTab.Markup.Html.Menu.Html.EditSource
Consider the Command attribute (which, in the example, is equals to EditSource)
search this command among SharePoint javascript files. Common architecture of ribbon handler involves javascript ""classes"" which can handle particular command. Each class has canHandleCommand method. Search under 14\layouts using pattern *.js by word (in the example, “EditSource”). Find handleCommand method in the class and take note of the line number.
in browser find this line and set a breakpoint, then you can step into to find the exact code that will be called (in the example, RTE.RichTextEditor.editSource() ). This is the handler

This file contains definition for all ribbon buttons in SharePoint. Search in this file by word Ribbon.EditingTools.CPEditTab.Markup.Html.Menu.Html.EditSource
Consider the Command attribute (which, in the example, is equals to EditSource)
search this command among SharePoint javascript files. Common architecture of ribbon handler involves javascript ""classes"" which can handle particular command. Each class has canHandleCommand method. Search under 14\layouts using pattern *.js by word (in the example, “EditSource”). Find handleCommand method in the class and take note of the line number.
in browser find this line and set a breakpoint, then you can step into to find the exact code that will be called (in the example, RTE.RichTextEditor.editSource() ). This is the handler

3419,3419,5443,What is the the Ehrenfest-Oppenheimer rule on the statistics of composite systems?,"Ehrenfest 1931 gives an argument to the effect that the application of the spin-statistics theorem to composite systems is valid, but only as an approximation and under certain conditions. Unfortunately this article is behind a paywall. The abstract reads as follows:


  From Pauli's exclusion principle we derive the rule for the symmetry of the wave functions in the coordinates of the center of gravity of two similar stable clusters of electrons and protons, and justify the assumption that the clusters satisfy the Einstein-Bose or Fermi-Dirac statistics according to whether the number of particles in each cluster is even or odd. The rule is shown to become invalid only when the interaction between the clusters is large enough to disturb their internal motion.


The quaintness of the abstract is enhanced by the mysterious failure to mention neutrons -- this being explained by the fact that the neutron was not discovered experimentally until the following year. Pretty amusing that the American Physical Society still owns the copyright on a paper this old, one of whose authors was probably paid through my grandparents' and great-grandparents' income taxes.

Googling quickly turns up various loose verbal characterizations of this result, without proof. Can anyone supply an outline of how the argument works and possibly a more precise statement of what the result really is?

Some sources seem to refer to this as the Wigner-Ehrenfest-Oppenheimer (WEO) result or Ehrenfest-Oppenheimer-Bethe (EOB) rule. Historically, Feynman seems to have used this result to show that Cooper pairs were bosonic.

Although I've tagged this question as quantum field theory, and the spin-statistics theorem is relativistic, the 1931 date seems to indicate that this would have been a result in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. This answer by akhmeteli sketches what seems to be a similar relativistic result from a book by Lipkin.

In the limit of low-energy experiments, the EO rule says the usual spin-statistics connection applies, and this seems extremely plausible. If not, then it would be too good to be true: we would be able to probe the composite structure of a system to arbitrarily high energies without having to build particle accelerators.

Bethe 1997 has the following argument:


  Consider now tightly bound composite objects like nuclei. It then makes sense to ask for the symmetry of the wavefunction of a system containing many identical objects of the same type, e.g., many He4 nuclei. This symmetry can be deduced by imagining that the interchange of two composites is carried out particle by particle. Each interchange of fermions changes the sign of the wavefunction. Hence the composite will be a fermion if and only if it contains an odd number of fermions[...]


Note the qualifier ""tightly bound,"" which implies a restriction to low-energy experiments. The abstract of Ehrenfest 1931 seems to say that this is a necessary assumption, but it is never used in Bethe and Jackiw's argument, and this suggests that their argument is an oversimplification.

Fujita 2009 recaps the Bethe-Jackiw argument, but then says:


  We shall see later that these arguments are incomplete. We note that Feynman used these arguments to deduce that Cooper pairs [5] (pairons) are bosonic [6]. The symmetry of the many-particle wavefunction and the quantum statistics for elementary particles are one-to-one [1]. [...] But no one-to-one correspondence exists for composites since composites, by construction, have extra degrees of freedom. Wavefunctions and second-quantized operators are important auxiliary quantum variables, but they are not observables in Dirac's sense [1]. We must examine the observable occupation numbers for the study of the quantum statistics of composites. In the present chapter we shall show that EOB's rule applies to the Center-of-Mass (CM) motion of composites.


Unfortunately I only have access to Fujita through a keyhole, so I can't see what the references are or any of the details that they promise in this beginning-of-chapter preview.

",Ben Crowell,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/4552,"An SE user was kind enough to send me a PDF of the paper, so I'll try to give a summary of my own understanding of it.

The historical context is interesting. This was before the neutron was discovered experimentally, so they thought nuclei were made out of protons and electrons. What we would today describe as a nucleus with mass number $A$ and atomic number $Z$, they would describe as a system consisting of $m$ protons plus $n$ electrons bound inside the nucleus, where $m=A$ and $n=A-Z$. (These $n$ electrons are in addition to the $m$ electrons that are outside the nucleus.) This model gets the statistics of a nucleus wrong when $N$ is odd, and the discrepancy had shown up in the spectroscopy of rotational bands of symmetric diatomic molecules such as $\text{N}_2$.

Regardless of whether you use the archaic model of the nucleus or a modern one, you're dealing with two species of fermions inside the nucleus. This leads to a lot of complications in the notation and equations, which I think is not really crucial to the content of what people would today describe as the Ehrenfest-Oppenheimer rule. I think all the interesting issues can be seen when there is only one species of fundamental fermion present, so that simplified version is what I'll outline here.

The argument, if I'm understanding it properly, seems to be as follows. You have two identical composite systems, which if not interacting would be described by internal quantum numbers $\sigma$ and $\tau$ and quantum numbers $s$ and $t$ describing their center-of-mass motions. Under interchange of the members of the two clusters, the wavefunction $|F\rangle=|st,\sigma\tau\rangle$ representing them has to pick up a phase $\theta=(-1)^k$. We can make such a wavefunction out of a Slater determinant. We then fairly trivially obtain --

The Ehrenfest-Oppenheimer rule: If the internal states of the two clusters are the same, $\sigma=\tau$, then under interchange of the centers of mass $s$ and $t$, the total wavefunction picks up a phase $\theta$.

If we now turn on an interaction between the two clusters, the E-O rule is no longer exact, and the meat of the paper is to show the conditions under which it is a sufficient approximation. The wavefunction F is no longer a stationary state. However, the set of such wavefunctions still represents a complete basis, so we can write the actual physical state $|\phi\rangle$ as a superposition of the F's. This mixes the F's, and the mixing destroys the symmetry under interchange of $s$ and $t$. However, the mixing depends on matrix elements of the form

$$ \langle st,\sigma\tau | H | s't',\sigma'\tau' \rangle $$

where $\sigma\ne\sigma'$, $\tau\ne\tau'$, i.e., the internal states are different.

Unfortunately this article is behind a paywall. The abstract reads as follows:


  From Pauli's exclusion principle we derive the rule for the symmetry of the wave functions in the coordinates of the center of gravity of two similar stable clusters of electrons and protons, and justify the assumption that the clusters satisfy the Einstein-Bose or Fermi-Dirac statistics according to whether the number of particles in each cluster is even or odd. The rule is shown to become invalid only when the interaction between the clusters is large enough to disturb their internal motion.


The quaintness of the abstract is enhanced by the mysterious failure to mention neutrons -- this being explained by the fact that the neutron was not discovered experimentally until the following year. Pretty amusing that the American Physical Society still owns the copyright on a paper this old, one of whose authors was probably paid through my grandparents' and great-grandparents' income taxes.

Googling quickly turns up various loose verbal characterizations of this result, without proof. Can anyone supply an outline of how the argument works and possibly a more precise statement of what the result really is?

Some sources seem to refer to this as the Wigner-Ehrenfest-Oppenheimer (WEO) result or Ehrenfest-Oppenheimer-Bethe (EOB) rule. Historically, Feynman seems to have used this result to show that Cooper pairs were bosonic.

Although I've tagged this question as quantum field theory, and the spin-statistics theorem is relativistic, the 1931 date seems to indicate that this would have been a result in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. This answer by akhmeteli sketches what seems to be a similar relativistic result from a book by Lipkin.

In the limit of low-energy experiments, the EO rule says the usual spin-statistics connection applies, and this seems extremely plausible. If not, then it would be too good to be true: we would be able to probe the composite structure of a system to arbitrarily high energies without having to build particle accelerators.

Bethe 1997 has the following argument:


  Consider now tightly bound composite objects like nuclei. It then makes sense to ask for the symmetry of the wavefunction of a system containing many identical objects of the same type, e.g., many He4 nuclei. This symmetry can be deduced by imagining that the interchange of two composites is carried out particle by particle. Each interchange of fermions changes the sign of the wavefunction. Hence the composite will be a fermion if and only if it contains an odd number of fermions[...]


Note the qualifier ""tightly bound,"" which implies a restriction to low-energy experiments. The abstract of Ehrenfest 1931 seems to say that this is a necessary assumption, but it is never used in Bethe and Jackiw's argument, and this suggests that their argument is an oversimplification.

Fujita 2009 recaps the Bethe-Jackiw argument, but then says:


  We shall see later that these arguments are incomplete. We note that Feynman used these arguments to deduce that Cooper pairs [5] (pairons) are bosonic [6]. The symmetry of the many-particle wavefunction and the quantum statistics for elementary particles are one-to-one [1]. [...] But no one-to-one correspondence exists for composites since composites, by construction, have extra degrees of freedom. Wavefunctions and second-quantized operators are important auxiliary quantum variables, but they are not observables in Dirac's sense [1]. We must examine the observable occupation numbers for the study of the quantum statistics of composites. In the present chapter we shall show that EOB's rule applies to the Center-of-Mass (CM) motion of composites.


Unfortunately I only have access to Fujita through a keyhole, so I can't see what the references are or any of the details that they promise in this beginning-of-chapter preview.

","An SE user was kind enough to send me a PDF of the paper, so I'll try to give a summary of my own understanding of it.

The historical context is interesting. This was before the neutron was discovered experimentally, so they thought nuclei were made out of protons and electrons. What we would today describe as a nucleus with mass number $A$ and atomic number $Z$, they would describe as a system consisting of $m$ protons plus $n$ electrons bound inside the nucleus, where $m=A$ and $n=A-Z$. (These $n$ electrons are in addition to the $m$ electrons that are outside the nucleus.) This model gets the statistics of a nucleus wrong when $N$ is odd, and the discrepancy had shown up in the spectroscopy of rotational bands of symmetric diatomic molecules such as $\text{N}_2$.

Regardless of whether you use the archaic model of the nucleus or a modern one, you're dealing with two species of fermions inside the nucleus. This leads to a lot of complications in the notation and equations, which I think is not really crucial to the content of what people would today describe as the Ehrenfest-Oppenheimer rule. I think all the interesting issues can be seen when there is only one species of fundamental fermion present, so that simplified version is what I'll outline here.

The argument, if I'm understanding it properly, seems to be as follows. You have two identical composite systems, which if not interacting would be described by internal quantum numbers $\sigma$ and $\tau$ and quantum numbers $s$ and $t$ describing their center-of-mass motions. Under interchange of the members of the two clusters, the wavefunction $|F\rangle=|st,\sigma\tau\rangle$ representing them has to pick up a phase $\theta=(-1)^k$. We can make such a wavefunction out of a Slater determinant. We then fairly trivially obtain --

The Ehrenfest-Oppenheimer rule: If the internal states of the two clusters are the same, $\sigma=\tau$, then under interchange of the centers of mass $s$ and $t$, the total wavefunction picks up a phase $\theta$.

If we now turn on an interaction between the two clusters, the E-O rule is no longer exact, and the meat of the paper is to show the conditions under which it is a sufficient approximation. The wavefunction F is no longer a stationary state. However, the set of such wavefunctions still represents a complete basis, so we can write the actual physical state $|\phi\rangle$ as a superposition of the F's. This mixes the F's, and the mixing destroys the symmetry under interchange of $s$ and $t$. However, the mixing depends on matrix elements of the form

$$ \langle st,\sigma\tau | H | s't',\sigma'\tau' \rangle $$

where $\sigma\ne\sigma'$, $\tau\ne\tau'$, i.e., the internal states are different. The resulting mixing is then small when the energy scale of the interaction between the two clusters is small compared to the energy differences $E_\sigma-E_{\sigma'}$ for $\sigma\ne\sigma'$. This is, for example, an excellent approximation for the nuclei in a diatomic molecule.

John and Mary's houses = the houses that belong jointly to John and Mary.

John's and Mary's houses = the houses that belong to John and Mary as individuals, at least one each.

However, I am curious if the rules are slightly different when possessive pronouns are used for a single item.

You and Mary's house OR your and Mary's house?

I'm even more unclear when the first person is involved.

Mary and my house OR Mary's and my house?

Finally, when there are at least three people, including the first person, does the last named person have the possessive-S/apostrophe, or all/none of them?


John, Mary and my house
John, Mary's and my house
John's, Mary's and my house


I'd be very grateful to anyone able to clarify this, ideally with a some form of reference, as I can't find it anywhere.



There have been several suggestions to use ""our"", yet if the text refers to a group of people, all of whom own co-own houses with some others within the group*, then the above style wording would be necessary, so my question stands.

* eg I own a house with John and Mary, I co-own another with Peter and yet another with Philip and Sarah.

WARNING! Spoilers Below!

If you haven't watched the series but plan to, you might not want to read what follows. I tried to separate setting spoilers from the system requirements, but it just didn't work.


The world is gritty and the power level is relatively low. It reminded me of Wild Cards, with ""the storm"" as the catalyzing event. Therefore, the system must support fine gradations in power - the scale is pretty low, so a small advantage needs to be representable.
Powers are uncontrollable - at least at first. Alisha's lust-inspiring power is uncontrolled as far as I have watched, and the immortality power (obviously) works without conscious effort. Curtis' time rewind is a power of huge significance, but it's not controlled by the beginning of the second season either. Therefore the system must support uncontrolled and unreliable powers.
The system you recommend must support regular humans as significant combat threats - Sally gave Simon a real fight. Player character death must be a real possibility.
This is also an ensemble drama, like Buffy, and much of the story is about the changing relationships between the characters.

I'm using the command, sort -k6 Photos so that it start sorting after the string ""photo"", can someone tell where I'm going wrong??
","You have to specify a field separator.

sort -n -to -k3 Photos

How can final variable change its value at the execution time, what the hell???
Actual value of variable is depend on value that I writing at sliders[i].setValue(4); But I don't know how exactly...

And I tried to set a watchpoint for this variable... Doesn't working. One time its zero and next time program stop in this for loop value is 9, 4 or whatever...
